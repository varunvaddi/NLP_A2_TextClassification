neg	"how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? 
isn't there a law or something ? 
this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst . 
mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison . 
writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . 
the plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father . 
deciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder . 
but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse , happy with his run-down little abode and wanting it to stay that way . 
the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe . 
whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue , terrible overacting , and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury , signifying nothing . 
the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is : "" i hate that mouse "" . 
oh cringe ! 
this is home alone all over again , and ten times worse . 
one touching scene early on is worth mentioning . 
we follow the mouse through a maze of walls and pipes until he arrives at his makeshift abode somewhere in a wall . 
he jumps into a tiny bed , pulls up a makeshift sheet and snuggles up to sleep , seemingly happy and just wanting to be left alone . 
it's a magical little moment in an otherwise soulless film . 
a message to speilberg : if you want dreamworks to be associated with some kind of artistic credibility , then either give all concerned in mouse hunt a swift kick up the arse or hire yourself some decent writers and directors . 
this kind of rubbish will just not do at all . 
"
neg	"some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . 
as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . 
rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . 
gloria is her latest disaster . 
babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . 
janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles . 
gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture . 
after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . 
it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . 
as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . 
she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . 
she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . 
an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . 
just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . 
 "" be a man , "" his father lectures him sternly . 
 "" don't trust nobody . 
not no broads . 
nobody . "" 
most of the film's leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . 
add in the movie's almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . 
lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . 
they stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . 
 ( "" say you're my baby , "" kevin coos demandingly . 
 "" i'm not gonna , "" gloria pouts back . ) 
the movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . 
the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . 
and in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . 
gloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . 
think her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? 
if you don't know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . 
you have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . 
when explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , "" you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . "" 
gloria runs 1 : 48 . 
it is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
"
neg	"my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . 
what an auspicious beginning ! 
welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . 
firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies . 
as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers . "" 
we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan . "" 
having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . 
when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . 
with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . 
not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . 
miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . 
in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . 
as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face . 
our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . 
in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . 
the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . 
this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . 
the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . 
will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ? 
she has only seconds to decide who will be saved . 
yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . 
not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . 
 ( "" hoods in the woods , "" is what the "" ground-pounders "" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) 
along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . 
most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . 
he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . 
arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . 
using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . 
when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . 
editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . 
the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . 
perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , "" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . "" 
firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . 
it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . 
"
neg	"to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this . 
a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay . 
also , a beautifully anti-climactic ending . 
not to say it didn't look intriguing when i saw the previews . 
so much for truth in advertising . 
roland emmerich , who's later "" independence day "" would look like "" the 400 blows "" compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens . 
in a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it . 
it wouldn't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actually figure it out . 
they're decipherer ? 
a slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who's life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word . 
why do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? 
so there is a hokey ending ! 
duh ! 
he figures it out in about a minute . 
yea . 
and then they get a suicidal colonel or something , "" jack "" o'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) . 
why a suicidal colonel ? 
for the ending ! 
you'll get the hang of this . 
they open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad . 
after an overdone special effects thing , they're . . . inside a goddam pyramid . 
so they went to egypt , right ? 
wrong . 
they're on another planet that was filmed in egypt . 
they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people . 
yea . 
also melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language . 
an anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( "" say hello to king tut , asswhole ! "" 
- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development . 
by the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don't know , the "" outer limits "" or something . 
the script's terrible . 
the special effects are okay , but nothing great . 
the story's so weak that it's almost opaque . 
the whole experience just isn't worth it unless you're so bored that you'd consider watching a "" full house "" marathon . . . or 
this . 
i'd pick this , obviously , but still , it's just not fun at all . 
and i can't wait for it to premier on mst3k .

neg	"synopsis : melissa , a mentally-disturbed woman who likes to smoke , seduces doug , a minor-league baseball player who likes to study anatomy , work on motorcycles , and make out with his girlfriend in a public library . 
when doug decides to stop seeing her , melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him , including his girlfriend , his mother , and his cat . 
comments : malicious , i suppose , is an acceptable moview for what it is : a cheap , b-movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned-psycho-lover-who-wants-revenge films ( like fatal attraction , hand that rocks the cradle , etc . etc . ) that have come before it . 
malicious , however , really doesn't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments . 
the plot starts off energetically enough , the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film . 
it starts to drag , unfortunately , after this . 
melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug ( as always seems to happen in movies like these ) , but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other , better thrillers before . 
she drugs someone . 
she kills a family pet and leaves it in the girlfriend's apartment . 
and , of course , she stalks , so we see a number of shots , which are supposed to be suspenseful , where she's spying on doug and his girlfriend . 
i won't reveal the ludicrous ending to this turkey , but i warn you that it's both painfully obvious and a real yawner . 
john vernon does a remarkably good job at playing the not-so-bright baseball jock who initially gets swept away by melissa ( one of the script's faults is to try to pass off a character like this as a pre-med student ) . 
the same cannot be said , though , for molly ringwald . 
at times , she can effectively pull off the obsessed lover routine , especially during her silent , i'm-going-to-stare-you-down scenes . 
at other times , however , she just seems somehow goofy and out of place . 
in one particular scene which i guess was supposed to be suspenseful , she screeches "" f--k you , you b-----d "" and throws a phone . 
she delivers the line so ridiculously that one can't help but laugh . 
malicious certainly isn't the worst thriller of its kind out in the video racks ( a number of really fat turkies in this genre are out there ) , but it isn't all that good or original either . 
feel free to treat this film maliciously , watch something else . 
"
neg	"tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . 
robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . 
he goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city . 
there , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . 
there , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . 
of course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . 
although the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . 
this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . 
it's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . 
even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . 
there also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . 
in planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy . 
in nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all . 
towards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , 
the director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . 
and although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . 
lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . 
however , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . 
in fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . 
nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . 
the humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . 
the characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' 
nothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . 
he nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose . 
"
neg	"in "" gia "" , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . 
and right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . 
i just don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . 
despite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . 
sadly , though , my fears were realized . 
it's just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . 
the movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn't particularly enjoy the world of fashion . 
she becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . 
the last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . 
this formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . 
in general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . 
no because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me . 
quite frankly , i don't see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . 
the first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . 
we see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . 
these early scenes were interesting . 
we're shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn't seen before . 
the movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model . 
>from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . 
it all seemed so excessive . 
fine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? 
couldn't the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? 
or perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . 
quite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . 
as i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don't see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . 
what do they do that warrants a movie ? 
strut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? 
i suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . 
gia did not . 
and by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . 
not exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i'm concerned . 
"
neg	"in 1990 , the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg . 
eight years later , moore and goldberg's careers aren't exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can't be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog . 
forget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games . 
good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey . 
along the way , jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station , evil truckers , and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists . 
every so often , like at the end of a video game "" level "" or "" stage , "" the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf , fresh from the triumph of spice world ) , who wants to steal the cache of guns . 
just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who's driving what , all of red's vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red . 
i could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack's dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance . 
all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting . 
once you've seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you've seen it every time . 
as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it's that swayze has to reduce himself to such work . 
while far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence . 
i don't know if it's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog . 
regardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ? 
"
neg	"upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases "" been there "" and "" done that "" come quickly to mind . 
spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series . 
stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff . 
what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka . 
agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith . 
along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act . 
the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical . 
spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films . 
the "" dick , the world is in danger . 
what is it ? 
well , it's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . . 
 ( i'm paraphrasing ) "" type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny . 
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother's films while writing their own dialogue . 
director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short . 
the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax . 
as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context . 
one of the more amusing was , "" captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james 
t . kirk "" . 
overall , i thought this was a very weak effort . 
while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods . 
next time they should "" spy "" a little bit harder . 
 * * * * = excellent . 
one of a kind . 
must see . 
 * * * = entertaining . 
worth the price of admission . 
 * * = fair . 
nothing much special . 
 * = what were they thinking ? ?

neg	" "" the 13th warrior "" comes at the end of as summer where we've already experienced man eating sharks ( "" deep blue sea "" ) , man eating crocodiles ( "" lake placid "" ) and even a man hunting witch ( "" the blair witch project "" ) . 
now , "" the 13th warrior "" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears . 
the story , if that's what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king's wife and is banished from his home land . 
he then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them . 
eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men . 
thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth . 
he's not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield . 
that's basically the entire plot . 
there is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn't just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story . 
instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer . 
the film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock . 
the battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting . 
we don't get to know any of the characters and so we don't care who lives and who dies . 
the film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action-adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels . 
it was directed by john mctiernan who's , "" the thomas crown affair "" is also playing in theaters currently . 
and it's not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , "" the 13th warrior "" was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences . 
it belongs back on the shelf . 
"
neg	"georges polti once wrote a paper called "" the thirty-six dramatic situations , "" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations . 
this may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , "" there's nothing new under the sun . "" 
the faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . 
there's not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . 
drawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . 
making use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather "" through the back door . "" 
parasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . 
the lack of gusto is the movie's major stumbling block . 
even though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they've been saved by an energetic approach . 
this casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson's ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn't pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . 
although he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . 
on that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . 
only the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . 
perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they'd all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la "" dawson's creek . "" 
needless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . 
there is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . 
in sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . 
"
neg	"actually , i'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . 
 "" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen . 
at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage . 
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire . 
you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . 
i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . 
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not . 
a nipple hallucination sort of thing . 
barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions . 
yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one . 
she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience . 
you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills . 
i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention . 
the movie is set in the year 2017 , "" the worst year of my life , "" pam says . 
 ( "" the worst movie of the year , "" i say . ) 
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) . 
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute . 
but don't call her "" babe . "" 
she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times . 
imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term . 
a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like "" babe "" during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success . 
the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners . 
in the words of one of the characters , they're "" more than meets the eye . "" 
reminds me of the "" transformers "" cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened . 
no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) . 
thank god they didn't name her cora reef . 
one bad character name is more than enough . 
pamela originally doesn't take sides , giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi "" always "" video fame . 
i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy ) . 
pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest . 
it's not rambo . . . 
it's bimbo ! 
mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year . 
it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin , the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free . 
it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo . 
there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen . 
someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars . 
if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements . 
barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death . 
this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct . 
barb wire has only two things going for it . . . 
and i think you know what those two things are .

neg	"here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ? 
done well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema . 
unfortunately , it isn't . 
with jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . 
fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . 
his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . 
he wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . 
this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . 
at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . 
meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . 
he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . 
it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . 
on its surface , it appears to be a kid's film . 
however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids . 
and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . 
if there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . 
the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . 
the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . 
the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . 
they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . 
maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . 
it certainly would have been more entertaining . 
wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . 
it starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise . 
parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first .

neg	"writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s . 
yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) . 
now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing . 
and guess what ? 
he succeeds once again ! 
plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems . 
it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients . 
critique : this film is not a comedy ! 
it is a drama . 
i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not . 
it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there . 
now on to my review . 
this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending . 
i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was . . . he 
missed ! 
anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible . 
it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy ! 
it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep . 
i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks . 
first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin . 
he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit . 
this kept me interested in watching him at least . 
number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few "" titshots "" , as they would say back in high school . 
and god help me if i can't get enough of those in an aimless drama . 
and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person . 
a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless . 
if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) , 
wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good . 
other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab . 
even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while . 
well , at least he finally "" came out "" and did some real skateboarding in this movie ! 
oh yeah , and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating . 
anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist . . . this 
film's your bag ! 
otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again . . . now 
there's a great shrink movie ! 
little known facts about this film and its stars : "" three's company "" fans alert ! ! ! 
terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film . 
the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids ! 
also , it is to note that the actress was once named "" penthouse pet of the month "" in march of 1976 . 
she was known as one joann witty back then . 
she's originally from jersey . 
who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ? 
you got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name . 
jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 . 
he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . he's been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) . 
listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the "" lost ark "" , which is obviously an in-joke , considering that it is the writer/director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) . 
kasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997's as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) . 
ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan's 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt .

neg	"one would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite "" x-files "" would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles . 
at least one would hope so . 
one would be seriously incorrect . 
eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more . 
it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence . 
ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer . 
using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life . 
smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate . 
he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization . 
blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital . 
sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film's babe factor . 
the would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help . 
on the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year's films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood . 
after a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment . 
an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he "" fixes "" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work . 
when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else . 
oddly enough , these seem like they could be exciting scenes . 
the film disproves that assumption . 
then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen . 
writing this only two days after seeing the film , its a struggle to remember the events . 
you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation . 
for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in "" x-files "" , it's a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma . 
the doctor is particularly bland and dull . 
even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal . 
a little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal . 
like virtually everything else in the film , it's a missed opportunity . 
the fox mulder detachment doesn't work here . 
oscar-winner hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on . 
played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer , blossom almost becomes real , but then sinks into goofiness . 
most of the time hutton looks as if he's searching for his character and coming up empty . 
jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery . 
the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen . 
the rest aren't any better . 
michael massee's eccentric fbi agent never revs up . 
one of blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer's doc holliday in "" tombstone "" . 
his two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film . 
but that 15 seconds isn't worth sitting through the other 90 minutes . 
first time film director andy wilson ( known for his work on the british television series "" cracker "" ) appears to be attempting to jump on the "" pulp fiction "" bandwagon . 
the best of these movies combine a sense of style and flash with significant substance . 
the second-rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects . 
 "" playing god "" does neither well . 
the basic idea of the film is solid . 
and then it goes nowhere . 
even worse , it plods back and forth , up and down a long and winding road before it ends up nowhere . 
fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life .

neg	"i should have known , damn it , i should have known . 
ewan mcgregor - codename : "" eye "" - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street . 
we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view . 
we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target's office . 
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . . 
maybe there's a really good reason for it . 
i've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor's previous work . . . 
and he's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god's sake . 
and director stephan elliot's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight . 
there's some genuine talent involved here . 
i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart . 
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ? 
national spy ring ? 
private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund . 
he has received his assignment from k . d . 
lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase . 
when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard . 
ok , that's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting . 
then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims "" merry christmas , dad ! "" 
for the first time . 
so begins our tale of obsession . . . 
or . . . something . 
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar . 
throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras . 
fine , that's a lovely premise , i suppose . 
but gosh darn it , if you're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation . 
and that's precisely where this film fails . 
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off . 
it's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end . 
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller . 
here , the filmmakers have confused "" surreal "" and "" deep "" with "" vaguely unclear "" and "" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . "" 
i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people . 
the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense . 
explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd . 
explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . "" 
whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed . 
that's as deep as it gets , folks . 
there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib . 
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was . 
my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot . 
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last . 
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space . 
any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed . 
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass . 
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell . 
jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . . 
cut to random guy with eye patch . . . 
iguana out of focus . . . 
iguana comes into focus . 
wow , man . 
when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me . 
there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story . 
and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . . 
not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing . 
the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition . 
some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking . 
someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , "" shut the hell up ! "" , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen . 
"
neg	"an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer . 
you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence . 
when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . 
the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves . 
all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office . 
the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking . 
the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! ' 
the writing behind this project is embarrassing . 
for your amusement , i will explain the plot . 
dr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on . 
as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences . 
when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler . 
kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team . 
there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking ! 
 ( a far superior film in any league ) . 
you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene . 
sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics . 
question : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? 
the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers . 
it's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula . 
i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors . 
the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny . 
the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute' . 
i suppose they are . 
i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute . 
other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . 
there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines . 
peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast . 
then again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . 
meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) . 
i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs . 
instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . 
or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters . 
anything to avoid this painful movie . 
the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' . 
sequel ? 
please have mercy . 
"
neg	"synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion . 
reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . 
comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . 
she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . 
the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . 
not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . 
it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating . 
the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . 
the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . 
to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . 
i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . 
i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . 
if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity . 
the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . 
a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , 
tramps about in the woods . 
with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . 
what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , 
leggings ) . 
tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , 
as the earthquake slowly recedes . 
a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . 
i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . 
this movie is really stupid . 
it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . 
also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . 
the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . 
a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . 
she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories . "" 
yep . 
we get it . 
we get it . 
the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . 
the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . 
as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . 
the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . 
the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . 
this movie also suffers from its new age trappings . 
maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . 
add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . 
the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while . 
it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . 
the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . 
the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . 
the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . 
although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people . 
the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . 
however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . 
typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . 
the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . 
i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . 
i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . .

neg	"call it a road trip for the walking wounded . 
stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . 
yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . 
playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . 
that's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . 
they haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . 
in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . 
 ( only in the movies , right ? ) 
too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . 
loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . 
despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree . 
kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . 
ain't they a pair ? 
unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . 
by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . 
this revelation exists purely for its own sake . 
aberdeen doesn't know where else to go . 
weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . 
if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . 
headey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . 
if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . 
it's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders . 
it's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . 
the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . 
in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . 
despite skarsg ? rd's solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . 
there's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . 
nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . 
if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama . 
aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . 
when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? 
the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin's hollywood mogul pronounces , "" all of life's riddles are answered in the movies ! "" 
even foreign films are taking that advice to heart .

neg	"it's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of "" award-winning "" tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes . 
that said , hayes's feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic . 
but occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary . 
those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film's two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno-deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over-protective , hyper religious , reagan-loving mother . 
gyllenhall's sweet-natured delivery of jimmy's hilariously na ? ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming-of-age story : jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld . 
his mom home-schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti-sexual messages , until he's befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door . 
jimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss . 
but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks-addled cross-country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love . 
the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy's rare handicap ( regardless of what the film's protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi . 
but even if you find stereotype humor funny , it's hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags . 
they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks . 
but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send-up of a cult called "" bright 'n shiny , "" led by the inimitable fabio . 
unfortunately , a few giggles can't make bubble boy the riotous , off-the-wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . 
honestly , it's a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i'm not just saying that because it's so mediocre . 
how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn't seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many . 
and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real-life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney's wondering the same thing . 
hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile .

neg	"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . 
be forewarned . 
to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . 
it would be derisive . 
it would be glib . 
it would be dismissive . 
it would be entirely accurate . 
rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . 
the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . 
the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . 
despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . 
consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . 
louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . 
 ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . ) 
meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice . 
serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . 
it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . 
it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . 
none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . 
director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . 
while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . 
to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . 
i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . 
to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . 
the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . 
the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching .

neg	"the first film produced by adam sandler's happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself . 
however the difference here is that this one joke just isn't very funny . 
rob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a "" man-whore "" to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client's custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home . 
deuce goes on numerous "" dates "" , and each woman he goes out with has a "" humorous "" quirk about herself . 
one has narcolepsy , one has tourette's syndrome , one is a man . . . 
etc . etc . 
my problem is that we see all of these women in the film's trailer , so why do i need to watch the movie ? 
seen the trailer . . . 
seen the film . 
only a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles . 
deuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) . 
the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and features the original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for mystery alaska , happy texas , and outside providence ) , an extremely brief production featurette ( which contains footage not used in the film ) , and storyboard-to-scene comparisons . 
yep , you read that right . . . 
there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd . 
two scenes are storyboarded . . . 
neither of which are particularly exciting . 
there are fight scenes in this movie , so why aren't we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ? 
i wonder what's funnier : the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or that di$ney thought fans of this film would want to see them ? 
deleted scenes ? 
sure . 
audio commentary ? 
you betcha . 
but storyboards ? 
come on .

neg	"by phil curtolo "" madonna - antonio banderas - jonathan price - in an alan parker film - with music from andrew lloyd weber - and lyrics by tim rice - evita . "" 
now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock-opera-turned-major motion picture is almost breath-taking for some . 
the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to . 
so why wouldn't the movie be wonderful to see . 
simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane . 
the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) , evita is full of drama that's trapped inside by all the notes and chords . 
she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker , then goes into the field of acting , and finally meets juan peron ( price ) , the soon-to-be first president of argentina . 
they fall in love and eventually marry . 
sounds pretty good , doesn't it . 
well the story gets better , as eva goes on the "" rainbow tour "" across europe , trying to win respect . 
eva duarte was a wonderful lady . 
however , all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood . 
i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right . 
they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar . 
although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye-catching , as was madonna's performance . 
as the "" spiritual leader of argentina , "" madonna would have definitely been an oscar-contender had she spoken a single line . 
but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film . 
don't get me wrong and don't look at my grade . 
i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen . 
if you're going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie . 
now i have to admit , it's a lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play , but that's what did me in . 
all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie . 
now you may be saying , "" what kind of critic is he ? , "" 
and you're right . 
as a critic , i should have given the movie a chance . 
but as a 17-year old quentin tarantino fan , it was way too hard .

neg	"barb wire , pamela anderson lee's first foray into films , highlights the fact that her only talent lies in her silicone enhanced assets . 
being the only notable member of the cast , the camera lingers lustily o n her body at every opportunity , making her character's catch line , "" don't call me babe , "" sound very ironic indeed . 
from the very opening of the movie , we are treated to a striptease routine from anderson , ending in her hurling her stiletto smack between the eyes of a lusty male who happened to call her babe . 
throughout the movie , there is ample footage of enormous breasts and cleavage , if not of anderson's , then at least of the female extras . 
this alone is enough to retitle the movie babe wire . 
for a plot , barb wire rehashes the casablanca storyline . 
it is 2017 , the middle of the second american civil war , and barb wire , a former resistance fighter , runs a joint in steel harbour called hammerhead ( ! ! ) . 
known for attracting resistance fighters an d characters of all sorts , the bar attracts the attention of the government forces who appear dressed in nazi-style uniforms . 
in between bashing up helpless males and showing off her trademark breasts , barb wire has to help a former lover and his wife get to the airport on the other side of the town , past the government-controlled areas , and to freedom . 
even the airport looks like the one in casablanca , except that the plane in the background is a modern , private jet . 
there are hardly any significant moments in this film , and one gets the impression that it was designed for young teenagers familiar with the dark horse comics version of "" barb wire . "" 
if anything , one leaves the film with the confirmation that anderson di d not do her own stunts . 
who could fight and jump in a skimpy , strapless leather top , and yet keep her breasts from spilling out ? 
only a stuntwoman . 
not pamela anderson lee . 
"
neg	"fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen . 
the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl . 
some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard . 
and what's more , this beast is heading for new york . 
gulp ! 
although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie . 
the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies . 
broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image . 
while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither . 
also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting . 
she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap . 
it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent . 
shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film . 
hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture . 
also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter . 
o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies . 
but what about the script ? 
well , that's not up to par either . 
emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script . 
the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) , 
broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . ) 
also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour . 
the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert . 
 ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene ! 
ha ha ha ha ! . ) 
the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e . 
velicorapters ) running around new york . 
right , so the script and acting suck . 
but what about the special effects ? 
thankfully , they're are quite good . 
godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark . 
the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell . 
but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie . 
the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending . 
and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel . 
let's just hope one never arrives . 
"
neg	"one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . 
such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . 
made in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , "" warped , twisted masterpiece "" of lynch clan . 
kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . 
but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion . 
the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . 
cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship . 
during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . 
after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh's stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . 
she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . 
apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn't got anything in common with the works of director's more talented father . 
despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . 
jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . 
the actors aren't good either . 
julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn't suit him . 
bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena's boyfriend . 
sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn't help this film . 
the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer's diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . 
one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh's "" regular "" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . 
the twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . 
all in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger's career .

neg	"capsule : godawful "" comedy "" that's amazingly shabby and cut-rate , and rather bereft of laughs . 
i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery . 
i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head . 
get some perspective . 
even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes . 
i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery . 
michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago . 
the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don't think i'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil . 
evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture . 
powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with . 
the basic gag , that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with . 
the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . . 
the movie's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions . 
one is dr . evil's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) . 
a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it's desperate rather than clever . 
instead of skewering the whole thing , it's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute . 
myers himself is also desperate : he's given an idea to play , not a character . 
plus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit "" nineties "" ) agent are a waste of time . 
i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one . 
with a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments . 
the movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes . 
the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap . 
my definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ? 
the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out . 
the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson's shorts and sent it sailing .

neg	"first troy beyer wrote the critically panned "" b . a . p . s . "" 
now she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . 
though not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . 
the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . 
jazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . 
she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . 
the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . 
the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . 
there are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 
in a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . 
that is not the case here . 
the script suffers from random plot developments . 
there are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question "" where did that come from ? "" 
at one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . 
we are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don't care if she and her mother get along . 
we've never seen her mother before . 
we never see her again . 
who cares ? 
what's worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . 
at another point , a character announces that she can't have children . 
apparently , this is devastating . 
we wouldn't know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . 
the scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . 
these scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . 
two scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . 
one scene is a lover's spat between two minor characters . 
the other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . 
thinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . 
but it does . 
first , it is original . 
we men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . 
it's something i don't think has been the subject of a film . 
second , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . 
taken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . 
the mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman's real experience . 
neither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . 
at some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . 
i can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their "" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , "" but on the whole , it's pretty bad . 
and that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . 
i'll give beyer one more strike , and then she's out . 
rated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity .

absolutely . 
the lack of humour wasn't the only issue that i had with this film either . 
the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision , but unfortunately , they are also lacking in conviction , believability and credibility . 
they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake . 
the actors were all adequate enough in their roles , but the problem didn't lie in the acting . 
i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time , but i can't . 
unless of course , you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house .

neg	"my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies . 
we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting . 
since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together . 
i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along . 
he was not amused . 
i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained . 
perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity . 
i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft . 
the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque . 
this movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy . 
the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean . 
an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect . 
in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed . 
the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good . 
the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets' . 
as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck . 
eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner . 
in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet . ' 
it's enough to melt the most callous heart . 
at another point she protests : `i'm human too , you know . ' 
she is only half right . 
peter medak , the director , knows his business . 
justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials .

neg	"how could a g-rated disney film based on meg cabot's novel "" the princess diaries "" be anything but cute , harmless fun ? 
easy . 
take all the cute , harmless fun out of it . 
and while you're at it make it borrr-ring . 
that's what director garry marshall , screenwriter gina wendkos and , not to be outdone , producer whitney houston have done with the g-rated disney film "" the princess diaries . "" 
you couldn't tell it from the audience though , a braintree , mass . of growing , glowing pre-pubescent girls ( and the odd parental , popcorn perched about their persons ) , who positively cheered when the end credits rolled ( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them but not with fuddy-duddy old me ) . 
well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious . 
too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall's film ( garry made a couple of other "" princess "" movies-- "" pretty woman "" and "" runaway bride "" --but this one's way without julia roberts so maybe * that's * its problem ) . 
in addition to being predictable as molasses , "" the princess diaries "" has hardly got a laugh in it ( it's a comedy ) , could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long , long stretches , and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven't even seen yet ( and probably never will except , perhaps , in the dvd edition ) . 
marshall should take virtually all of the blame here , since he's been at this for some time and should know when a scene or two isn't working . . . 
and hardly * any * of "" the princess diaries "" works ( "" works , "" alas , implies cleverness and there's none of that here either ) . 
newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule "" genovia "" ( hence the headphones/tiara combo in the print ads ) . 
julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) . 
does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ? 
not really . 
consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets . 
also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky-looking best friend ( "" welcome to the dollhouse "" 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic/musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia's chauffeur-driven limousine at every intersection . 
a non-animated g-rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product . 
lame , labored , and lamentable , "" the princess diaries "" is recommended for eight-and-a-half year olds of the feminine persuasion * only * ; all others would do well to avoid it ( like potholes , the plague , and "" the perfect storm "" ) .

neg	"it's a good thing most animated sci-fi movies come from japan , because "" titan a . e . "" is proof that hollywood doesn't have a clue how to do it . 
i don't know what this film is supposed to be about . 
from what i can tell it's about a young man named kale who's one of the last survivors of earth in the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving and re-generating what is left of the human race . 
that's a fine premise for an action-packed sci-fi animated movie , but there's no payoff . 
the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy in their search for a legendary ship that the evil "" dredge "" aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason . 
so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fights , fistfights , blaster fights and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick at . 
there's so much pointless sci-fi banter it's too much to take . 
the galaxy here is a total rip-off of the "" star wars "" universe the creators don't bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing , the characters unmotivated and superficial and the plot just plain boring . 
despite the fantastic animation and special effects , it's just not an interesting movie . 
"
neg	"senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . 
alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise . 
granted , that one joke is initially amusing . 
when wayans's darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . 
after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . 
at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless . 
this sets up some showcase moments for wayans's gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp . 
but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale . 
once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness . 
wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he's simply treading water for the rest of the film's unfunny duration . 
senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . 
however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . 
darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this "" serious "" angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . 
unlike wayans's last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the "" emotional "" content of senseless is forced and unconvincing . 
any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl's romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind . 
once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him . 
but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television .

neg	"starring kiefer sutherland ; reese witherspoon & bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen . 
freeway is giving me second thoughts . 
freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood . 
only in the nineties , little red riding hood is a foul-mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) . 
to top that pathetic premise off -- reese goes to visit granny and you'll never guess who's waiting under the cover's in granny's bed . 
keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented , yet underrated actors , and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented and will most likely become a major star . 
so what are they doing in this movie ? 
after seeing the end result , undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the same question . 
you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review . 
the answer is quite simple -- i dont want to waste any more of my time writing or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary . 
i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it . 
note to keifer : you wonder why you aren't a bigger star in hollywood ? 
because you keep making movies like this . 
note to reese : you were great in fear , what happened this time ? 
note to both : don't worry about it too much , no one saw this movie anyway . 
bottom line -- i'm still shaking my head . 
don't waste your time on this turkey . 
if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie , go rent flatliners or young guns . 
reese witherspoon's abundant acting talents are used to their full potential in fear , a great thriller . 
do yourself a favor and rent one of these movies -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can .

neg	"starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . 
junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . 
these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . 
so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . 
so much for hopes . 
schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . 
unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . 
still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . 
so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . 
their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . 
does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? 
well , it must have to the producers of junior . 
admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . 
perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . 
but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . 
the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . 
schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . 
i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . 
better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? 
anything would have been better than this mess . 
danny devito is wasted in this movie . 
his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . 
 ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) 
emma thompson is wasted here as well . 
while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . 
too bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here . 
am i being too hard on this film ? 
i don't think so . 
schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . 
with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . 
they certainly managed here . 
maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . 
if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents .

neg	"please don't mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam . . . i 
just want to warn all of y'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda . 
it's not even worth a 99-cent video rental . 
don't listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he's talking about ! ) 
btw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper ) . 
now i'll actually back up my huffing and puffing . 
here goes : 
movie : anaconda rydain's bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . 
even then , i doubt it's worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) 
why do i hate anaconda ? 
let me count the ways . . . 
first of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong . 
as an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they're scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake's mouth , and constrictor snakes don't kill what they can't eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn't run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can't make funny squealing noises . 
whew . 
i was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it . 
unfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel . 
my friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end . 
anybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually . 
that was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn't give up and fall asleep . 
he was the most likable character in the movie . 
who wouldn't enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? 
anaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube's character and the british guy , for instance . 
however , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock . 
the writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines . 
i was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny . 
did she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? 
of course not ! 
 "" i'm trying to work ! "" 
gee , that's even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with . 
she could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . . 
 ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks ) . 
as for the plot , i'm still trying to find one . 
this movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous , computer-generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster-than-gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet . 
 ( harrier snake ? ) 
not to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . 
the writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy's g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . 
that was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . 
 ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i'd be most grateful ! 
all the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) 
i wasn't inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . 
i can't blame the actors , though . 
it's not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . 
this concludes rydain's diatribe on a shameless exploitation ( and perpetuation ! ) of public fear of snakes . 
comments , flames , anyone ?

neg	"when i originally saw the trailer for "" analyze this "" a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame . 
and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad . 
but then when "" analyze this "" finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened . 
it got great reviews . 
critics were proclaiming it "" hilarious "" and a "" dead-on parody of mob movies "" . 
well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater . 
you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ? 
well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for . 
 "" analyze this "" is slow , unfunny , and badly acted . 
don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here . 
i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material . 
he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama . 
if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the "" naked gun "" series , he probably would have been a lot more successful . 
as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others . 
this doesn't work . 
it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him . 
and the movie is badly paced , too . 
it never takes off . 
it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum . 
i think the blame for this should be placed on the script . 
it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere . 
the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues . 
this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie . 
i've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny . 
if "" analyze this "" had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me . 
i would have been too busy laughing to notice . 
but as it is , i only chuckled a few times . 
the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of "" the godfather "" . 
sadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing . 
but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population . 
i loathed "" there's something about mary "" , yet loved "" baseketball "" . 
now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see "" office space "" . 
it's full of genuine laughs and won't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as "" analyze this "" did .

neg	"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . 
he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . 
with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . 
what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . 
the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . 
but where are the thrills ? 
the laughs ? 
both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . 
and what a shame that is . 
i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty . 
kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . 
teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . 
or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . 
i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . 
the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren . 
mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils . 
the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . 
i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . 
mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . 
in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . 
the plot is a big problem here . 
material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . 
the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . 
but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . 
later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . 
leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . 
alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . 
in the morning . . . 
how convenient ! 
the three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . 
things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . 
the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . 
of course , not everything goes entirely to plan . 
besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . 
there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . 
the humor is completely inconsistent . 
after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . 
you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . 
a moment like that never arises . 
williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . 
and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . 
on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . 
while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . 
there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . 
mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . 
she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . 
if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . 
basically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . 
his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . 
we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real .

neg	"it's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends . 
still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . 
she can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club . 
everywhere she looks , she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand . 
in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway . 
to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean . 
however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends . 
julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal . 
needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island . 
accompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie . 
but was this contest too good to be true ? 
the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . 
meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . 
this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . 
eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . 
as you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook . 
julie tries to convince her friends that the killer is on the island ( an eerie touch is when she is singing "" i will survive "" at the karaoke bar and the words scroll "" i still know . . . "" ) , but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . 
but the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it's going to be the worst vacation of her life . 
the funny ( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . 
this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness . 
there isn't even any suspense that leads up to the deaths . 
here's an appropriate example . 
knock-knock . 
 "" housekeeping "" , says the diminuitive cleaning lady . 
the door suddenly opens up . 
slash . 
next victim ! 
is there any reason to go and see this movie ? 
not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes . 
but i do want to say one thing about this movie that satisfied me . 
i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell , who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido . 
i secretly wished for him to get filleted . 
did he get 'hooked' ? 
well , let's just say that if he didn't , i would give this film a grade of "" d "" .

neg	"by starring in amy heckerling's "" clueless "" two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn't just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of "" the crush "" -- out of the water . 
her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june's "" batman & robin , "" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . 
now , she's the star and producer of "" excess baggage , "" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level . 
silverstone's emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally . 
in an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw . 
but before the police can "" rescue "" her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who's still trapped in the back . 
when vincent discovers emily , the two don't exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there . 
along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation . 
it doesn't help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who's wise to his niece's ploys for attention and has mafia connections . 
for at least a half-hour , "" excess baggage "" bounces along fast and efficiently . 
during this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor . 
but once it's past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once . 
a road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and "" excess baggage "" likely covers its territory . 
of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome . 
 "" do you like my tummy ? "" 
emily coos to vincent at one point in the film . 
huh ? 
did i miss something ? 
the hard-edged , foul-mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo-goo eyes . 
then again , "" excess baggage "" becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise . 
a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn't game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded . 
motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative . 
scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions . 
 "" excess baggage "" has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand . 
i loved silverstone's turn in "" clueless "" as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen's "" emma . "" 
looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it's simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for "" excess baggage . "" 
sadly , however , "" excess baggage "" is no "" clueless . "" 
but , on the other hand , it is clueless .

neg	"retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) 
a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson 
i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as "" dim-witted "" . 
and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . 
although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them . 
two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure . 
and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction . 
the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts . 
for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . 
the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . 
that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? 
and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ? 
anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches . 
fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film's flimsy script and plodding direction . 
the dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable . 
not bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious "" lets explain the plot "" type approach . 
mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch . 
and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses . 
christopher george's performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care . 
in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn't mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond . 
as a director , some of fulci' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here . 
he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren't capable of . 
and despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film . 
long-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that's quite frankly embarrassing . 
fulci's other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey . 
for completists only .

neg	" "" the beach "" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . 
every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . 
it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . 
but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "" blue lagoon "" . 
forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of "" lord of the flies "" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . 
by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . 
the main character of "" the beach "" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . 
he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time . 
richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . 
this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . 
he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . 
he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . 
though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . 
moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . 
captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . 
they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's . 
once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise . 
this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard . 
etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . 
it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . 
and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . 
for example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . 
and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . 
there are several ideas that are introduced in "" the beach "" and each one could merit its own feature-length film . 
there's the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle . 
but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . 
dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . 
consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up .

neg	"when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the "" inspector gadget "" tv show with my older brother . 
truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis . 
i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that . 
sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . 
at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . 
despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up . 
so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) . 
i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . 
rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness . 
as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . 
can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? 
right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . 
in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones . 
when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( "" oh , hi penny ! 
is brain with you ? "" ) . 
creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . 
the "" plot "" , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series . 
matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) , 
a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events . 
brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . . 
inspector gadget ! 
>from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) . 
there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . 
to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these "" treats "" . 
i was just glad that it was over . 
"
neg	"there are scenes in "" the big hit "" that are so awful , they simply defy description . 
the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . 
presumably , "" the big hit "" is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off . 
movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . 
 "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny . 
unfortunately , in "" the big hit , "" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . 
unfortunately , there are no laughs . 
the movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence . 
instead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's "" boogie nights . "" 
however , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market . 
wahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see "" grosse pointe blank "" for the same character , much better developed ) . 
the movie wants us to think , "" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him . "" 
the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money . 
his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst . 
melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) . 
one day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . 
however , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter . 
so , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . 
not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . 
of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . 
along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by "" jurassic park , "" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen ) . 
what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . 
not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of "" king kong lives , "" which is two weeks overdue . 
this mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( "" face/off "" ) , who also served as executive producer . 
woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . 
wong , who directed such films as "" rock'n'roll cop "" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . 
maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they're not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . 
many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . 
in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey's script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . 
what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is "" it's all love "" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco's stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . 
the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole . 
"
neg	"ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life . 
unfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie . 
actually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie . 
not only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . 
the plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . 
it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . 
but no one has arrived yet . 
her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . 
some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . 
but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . 
those who are invited are the ones that have the issues . 
it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . 
first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . 
he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . 
bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . 
they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . 
he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . 
his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . 
as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . 
moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . 
val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . 
on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . 
paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . 
of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . 
wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . 
paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . 
however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . 
finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . 
jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . 
while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . 
very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . 
however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . 
instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . 
first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . 
at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . 
there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . 
not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . 
and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . 
perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . 
but it didn't happen that way . 
the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .

neg	"capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill-conceived . 
this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons . . . 
extended review : you know , about halfway through this movie , i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes , you'd have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy , hong kong style martial arts . 
beautifully choreographed by robin shou , who also plays liu kang , the fight scenes are both mind-blowing and graceful , acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep . 
this is what made the original so fun , but unfortunately for the sequel , we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson . 
instead , they got john r . leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat . 
not a good choice . 
while the fight scenes are brutal and eye-popping , the rest of the movie looks like standard made for tv fare . 
the acting is sub-par , which i could endure if it were not for a . ) the director's style , b . ) the special effects , & c . ) the treatment of the story and characters . 
a . ) mr . leonetti should go back to lighting , in my opinion . 
i could say dozens of bad things about him : he way overuses slow-motion , he has no eye for action , he can't get even mediocre performances out of actors , and so on . 
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping . 
apparantly , everybody can now fly . 
hell , i'm all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick and whatnot , but not when it happens every few minutes , and is done so poorly . 
better jumping and acrobatics has been seen in xena : warrior princess . 
in short , they should have gotten paul anderson back . 
or at least let robin shou direct . . . 
b . ) unlike the first one , whose sfx were vibrant and somewhat realistic , mk : a's special effects are bland , fake looking , and overall just plain bad . 
i counted at least half a dozen times that blue-screening was painfully obvious . 
had this movie been made in the 80's , it would have been ground-breaking . 
but in today's industry , it doesn't even look finished . 
c . ) now for the _really_ bad parts . 
i admit , i'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series . 
the games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger . 
the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride . 
this could have been a really cool movie . 
it isn't . 
the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers . 
some of the plot elements are just plain stupid . 
how stupid ? 
take , for instance , how our heroes move around . 
they use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour . . . oh 
boy . . . 
even worse is the treatment of secondary characters . 
blink and you'll miss 'em . 
most characters had more depth in the video games . 
if you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ain't seen nothin' yet . 
a good 75% of the characters are introduced , kick somebody around a bit , then either die or are forgotten about . 
there's no explanation at all for this . 
and for the final blasphemy , the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for , the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie , lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of . . . ended . 
it almost made me weep . 
to sum it all up , rent it on video , and fast-forward through everything except the fight scenes . 
"
neg	" "" goodbye , lover "" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may , and one look will tell you why . 
it's a mess . 
and that's * way * before ellen degeneres shows up . 
the film is one of those torrid double-indemnity crime stories that , in this case , required the services of three screenwriters . 
i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller , one wrote a murder mystery , and one wrote a comedy , then director roland joff ? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment . 
i didn't laugh at ellen degeneres much ( i think i was supposed to ) . 
degeneres is horrible and her character is even worse , a tough-talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe and bad hair . 
either degeneres is wearing a wig--as most of the actors appear to be--or she doesn't yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist . 
every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy and hip , but her incessant wisecracking is poorly-written and merely stupid . 
her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is "" at least she died healthy . "" 
and that's one of her wittier asides . 
degeneres' sgt . 
rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of . . . wait . 
to give away too much of the plot would all but ruin a film that has very little going for it outside of its numbing plot twists and multiple triple-crosses . 
it's best described this way : 
sultry sexpot/real estate agent sandra dunmore ( patricia arquette ) is married to jake , a "" creative yet unfocused "" ( and alcoholic ) advertising rep , played by dermot mulroney . 
sandra likes to act out her deep-seated sexual fantasies and jake's brother ben ( the suave-as-ever don johnson ) likes to help . 
ben is also coming on to his petite , mousy co-worker peggy blaine ( mary-louise parker ) and someone , somewhere , is planning to cash in on that huge life insurance policy of his . 
the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other and back again . 
although there are some genuine surprises , the plot twists get too contrived too quickly . 
probably around the time degeneres' gumcracking gumshoe appears . 
at least the former "" ellen "" star is going for something a little different . 
arquette turns in yet another of her stiletto-heeled , platinum blonde bombshell roles ( see : "" lost highway , "" "" true romance "" ) while quoting embarrassing lines like "" i'm not wearing any underwear . "" 
i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this . 
here's an example of some of the film's flat-out stupidity . 
sandra purchases a used car and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film's duplicitous lovers . 
she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite "" the sound of music "" on her car stereo , intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims . 
so what was the point of the wig and the car ? 
 "" the sound of music "" stuff might be a reference to "" the wizard of oz "" allusions in david lynch's "" wild at heart , "" but if so joff ? must have forgotten that "" wild at heart "" was a despicable movie . 
it's hard to believe that "" goodbye , lover "" was directed by the same person who made "" the killing fields "" and "" the mission . "" 
it's not , however , hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long . 
it should have stayed there . 
"
neg	"wow , a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever . 
i'm amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen . 
many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on their race . 
i think first they need to concentrate their energy on themselves , and stop making movies which makes them look like nothing more than sex-crazed buffoons . 
even i'm offended by it . 
bill bellamy is a "" player "" which means he sleeps with a lot of women and lies to them . 
what a pleasant main character . 
one day , his friends decide that they want to find out how to be a player . 
why they decide this "" one day "" i have no idea . 
how many years have they been friends and why all of a sudden would they want to learn ? 
anyway , bellamy agrees to teach , and his wonderful lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house to house having sex with women . 
this is the bulk of the film folks , guys riding from house to house , one keeps getting out to have sex , while the others sit in the car . 
since russell simmons is producer , and since the official title of the film is "" def jam's how to be a player "" , i was ready to be jumping up and down and stomping my feet and beating the person next to me because of the comedy . 
amazingly , aside from gilbert gottfried's 90 seconds of screen time , there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner . 
instead of jokes , there's just an endless stream of profanity and naked breasts ( and naked breasts aren't so bad , but naked breasts alone don't make a good movie ) . 
be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well . 
gilbert gottfried's character serves as one in his very brief appearance , asking for explanations as to what is being said . 
they should have brought him along for the entire film .

neg	"i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 . 
the best way i can put it is that it's funky . 
i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of "" police academy 4 : citizens on patrol "" , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song "" citizens on patrol "" during the opening credits ? 
it's just like that . 
anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) . 
this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . 
it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me . 
she's the lone survivor this time . 
part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects . 
jason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he's completely bald . 
also , it being one day later , it can't be friday the 13th now can it ? 
oh well . 
steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series .

neg	"when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store . 
masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read . 
of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history . 
given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of "" trillions "" and make a live-action masters movie . 
let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie . 
the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible . 
it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars . 
we have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that "" deja vu "" is too polite a term to use in describing it . 
 "" blatant uninspired ripoff "" would appear more appropriate . 
tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either . 
so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ? 
yes , there is . 
one incredible good reason . 
his name is frank langella . 
langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years . 
here he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece . 
dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper . 
given this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision . 
skeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right . 
masters of the universe . 
i remember loving it when i was eleven . 
at twenty one it's difficult to see why . 
but , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder . 
besides , this year marks the film's 10th anniversary . 
watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate .

neg	"if anyone had been able in 1983 to forsee a late-night cable show hosted by gilbert gottfried showcasing some of the worst films of the 80's , they'd agree d . c . cab is the quintessential "" usa up all nite "" movie . 
it's one of those childish r-rated movies that kids would love but can't see until it's edited for tv . 
it's also one of those pointless , almost plotless movies with hardly any laughs . 
and , strike three , it pairs mr . t with gary busey . 
i heard gilbert say d . c . cab had "" an all-star cast , "" but i'm still hoping there was some degree of facetiousness in that statement . 
when third-billing goes to a two-minute appearance by famed flashdancer irene cara "" as herself , "" you can't say a damn thing about all-star casts . 
likewise for token appearances by marsha "" roz "" warfield , paul rodriguez and "" politically incorrect "" host bill maher , before he was somebody . 
appearing in d . c . cab pretty much had the opposite effect on everyone else , especially irene "" i'm gonna live forever "" cara . 
d . c . cab is an ensemble comedy from joel schumacher ( who would go on to direct batman forever ) about a bunch of misfits who drive cabs . 
you get the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the "" token white guy "" ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word "" honkey "" as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr . t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin ) . 
we've all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80's . 
some are fun to watch and some are actually funny . 
this one is more or less neither . 
you'd think plenty of comedic sparks would fly from the assemblage of talent ( whatever ) , but d . c . cab more or less falls flat on a continual basis , culminating in the usual contrived hollywood finale as baldwin is kidnapped and the other cabbies have to go to rescue him . 
it's a shame no one was able to rescue this movie from the depths of stale jokes and unoriginality . 
d . c . cab has rightly earned its position on "" usa up all nite . ""

neg	"the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon . 
as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque . 
the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude . 
when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style "" chance brushstrokes . "" 
starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie . 
the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections . 
the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man . 
daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer . 
when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex . 
he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed . 
he thinks that francis's paintings have "" no bloody use , "" and the movie presents no counterargument . 
writer maybury barely outlines francis's character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma . 
we learn little of george other than francis's reason for liking him -- george's "" amorality and innocence . "" 
francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often . 
 "" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , "" he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match . 
as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood . 
francis appears to be in complete ecstasy . 
another of francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities . 
as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience . 
in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident . 
francis's mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother , the father , and the boy . 
sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis's wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful . 
 ( "" i'm optimistic by nature . 
i'm optimistic about nothing . "" 
 "" loneliness is my only true companion . "" ) 
we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself . 
he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth . 
full of metaphorical interpretations , the film's best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom . 
mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly . 
like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling . 
by the end , the audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute sketch . 
love is the devil runs 1 : 30 . 
the film is not rated but should be considered nc-17 for violence , profanity , graphic sex , nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers .

neg	"this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company . 
based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . 
when he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador . 
her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages . 
she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead . 
meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her . 
however , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire ! 
this film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' . 
it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written . 
newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad . 
kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script . 
the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing . 
in fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements . 
however , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades . 
an awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline . 
its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next ! 
jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile . 
a complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies . 
it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 ! 
avoid at all costs !

neg	" "" varsity blues "" is the best film of 1999 thus far . 
unfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 . 
it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-heartedfrom 1999 . 
it is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the "" big game . "" 
by the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? 
will everyone in the town turn against the coach ? 
will the team win the climactic game ? 
do cats bathe themselves regularly ? 
the so-called "" hero "" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . 
at least he's got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . 
heck , in one scene , the front page of the town's newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers' big win the night before . 
when the team's star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team's leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . 
and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the "" bad guy "" ) . 
worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john's scholarship chances if the badgers don't win their final game . 
the plotting of "" varsity blues "" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . 
admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . 
throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983's "" all the right moves . "" 
one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv's "" dawson's creek "" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . 
while i probably shouldn't blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and "" by-the-numbers "" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn't of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in "" all the right moves . "" 
the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . 
the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . 
smart does not allow her character to become the "" passive girlfriend , "" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . 
it's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . 
the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . 
john's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . 
his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn't want any part of that . 
his mother stands beside her "" big , strong husband "" and is a passive female . 
finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . 
saving "" varsity blues "" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . 
the scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn't overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . 
but leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? 
i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . 
do we really need another high-school sports film ? 
no , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . 
 "" varsity blues , "" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . 
"
neg	"a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . 
at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise . 
after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . 
the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . 
and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) , 
love . 
so far , so mediocre . 
but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance . 
it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . 
this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . 
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . 
not that there is much of a romance to begin with . 
try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . 
celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . 
as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . 
when celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . 
but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . 
boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . 
the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . 
and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . 
watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . 
instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . 
my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing "" beyond the sea "" at a karaoke bar . 
after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . 
the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . 
alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . 
i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . 
a life less ordinary certainly delivers something "" different , "" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . 
 "" i can accept failure . 
everyone fails at something . 
but i can't accept not trying . 
it doesn't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . ""

neg	"i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws . 
but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american . 
or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence . 
this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . 
if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . 
although geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself . 
this is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) . 
in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind . 
it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail . 
it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful . 
yet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch . 
he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison . 
his cell , food and rights  all terrible . 
now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder . 
jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family .  
as the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered . 
red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes . 
what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act . 
this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption . 
but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch . 
if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . 
it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . 
if that wasnt bad enough , red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions . 
shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself . 
taking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be . 
although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the films main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway . 
whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again .

neg	"if you're the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! 
indeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . 
it's difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . 
but at least we're warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . 
what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? 
first , the movie gives us an introductory premise . 
huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . 
oooh . . . scary ! 
secondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . 
third , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) . 
he operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . 
finally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . 
they are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are . 
during their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs . 
spotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . 
little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster . 
yet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds . 
this is nothing more than a by-the-book action film . 
their realization of the situation that they're in doesn't happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . 
those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . 
the corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . 
yet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary "" boo "" moments . 
but most of it is just outright silly . 
and this film is unusually gory too . 
monsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . 
there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . 
he screams horribly as the monster's digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . 
additionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . 
the mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . 
to be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . 
it's moronic fun at best . 
so , if you're hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot .

g wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they don't really want all that commercial crap . 
in some unexplained manner , this causes sales to sour . 
ricky is saved . 
the movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all . 
it's not an over-the-top comedy or a heart-warming message of humanity .

i never would have thought of these . 
the opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed . 
when g takes a chainsaw to the set , there's an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious . 
it doesn't happen . 
the bits are so subdued and overly-long that there's only a hint of laughter from the audience . 
murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not for the better . 
there are hints of promise in this one . 
the only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved-headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen . 
the others are horrendous . 
goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career , but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his "" invasion of the body snatchers "" . 
his relationship with kate makes no sense . 
they move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen . 
preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be . 
somewhere hidden deep inside of this film is about ten minutes of value . 
an attempt to satirize stupid television , we get a self-parody instead .

neg	"i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on . 
i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley's on-edge , extreme acting was a riot . 
so naturally , when the trailer for "" almost heroes "" hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down . 
a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big breakthrough . 
i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley's best , in spite of david spade's absence . 
i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran . 
sadly , none of this came to pass . 
the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between . 
perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with . 
and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it's a farley flick . 
the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second . 
perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley . 
and farley's classic humor is widespread , too . 
almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot . 
guys , let's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ? 
stick to "" tommy boy "" , and we'll all be "" friends "" . 
"
neg	"for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . 
in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . 
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . 
france was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england . 
there was no strong political leadership in the country . 
morale was low , there being little hope for the future . 
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions . "" 
convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him . 
the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown . 
he does . . . 
and she does . 
then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors . 
director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material . 
the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable . 
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role . 
ms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse . 
if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant . 
since it isn't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part . 
her joan is unbalanced , "" inspiring "" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed . 
john malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii . 
an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death . 
faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor . 
the army under joan's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers . 
the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan's arrival . 
trying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan's insistence on following her "" visions . "" 
dustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan's conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial . 
dressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her "" revelations . "" 
as well she should . 
scriptures do speak of revelation . 
god , via his gift of holy spirit , is able to communicate to men . 
three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation . 
they are : word of knowledge , word of wisdom , and discerning of spirits . 
even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his "" holy men . . . 
who spake as they were moved by holy spirit ( i . e . 
by revelation . ) "" 
but the scriptures also caution us : 
 "" beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world . "" 
1 john 4 : 1 [kjv] 
joan's end , ( being burned at the stake at the age of 19 ) , the frenzy ( mob rule ) and blood lust her inspiration wrought , and the death , pain , or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one . 
while her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality , she was , as others have been before and since , misled by the spiritual master of deception . 
as a messenger , she was quite effective . 
she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying .

no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football . 
rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in "" the 13th warrior , "" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory . 
based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought . 
their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword . 
luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film . 
antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador . 
accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village . 
we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude . 
they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won . 
but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land . 
help is needed quickly . 
an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives . 
after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "" not of norse blood "" are needed to ensure victory . 
personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity . 
nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th . 
the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives . 
of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors . 
but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog . 
he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? 
it does not look promising . 
these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale . 
they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies . 
they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon . 
the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods . 
they are ready to sacrifice their lives . 
 "" this is a good way to die , "" says one of the fallen warriors . 
despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience . 
at many points , i was even confused . 
for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land . 
he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis . 
however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion . 
there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate . 
the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma . 
however , banderas's role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special . 
an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order . 
also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow . 
i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy . 
as it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity . 
it would make thor cry .

neg	"sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ? 
yup , it's gotta be summer . 
just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct-to-video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow-up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed . 
the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff . 
sound exciting ? 
dennis hopper's disgruntled bomb squader , the villain of the first film , has given way to willem dafoe's disgruntled computer programmer , a maniac whose main beef has something to do with having to use live leeches , i kid you not , as a self-treatment for copper poison- ing . 
 ( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro- magnetic fields , no less ! 
calling dean edell . . . ) 
so , he overrides the boat's computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn't evacuate in time , on a col- lision course with destiny . 
 ( oddly , no one thinks to just . . . 
jump off the back of the boat . ) 
with keanu reeves electing not to return-- perhaps he read the script ? -- 
the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated . 
 ( what are the odds ? ) 
they're on this caribbean cruise for pleasure , as are a handful of requisite stock characters , including a deaf teenager ( ! ) who has a crush on the hero ( ! ! ) who also knows how to sign ( ! ! ! ) . 
 ( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ? 
wait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! ) 
bullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests . 
 ( those paying attention to her bikini- and tank- tops probably won't complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that's damn good , 'cause when he stops to talk , he's only slightly less monotone than his predecessor . 
 ( his first lol line is to ms . bullock : "" i'd like to boogie with you . "" ) 
of course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does . 
he also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards . 
 ( con air , buddy , father's day , romy and michelle's high school reunion , murder at 1600 , 8 heads in a duffle bag , anaconda , vegas vacation , meet wally sparks , metro , bevery hills ninja , the relic , all is forgiven ) . 
worse , he's spent a hundred mil on a premise that doesn't even live up to its title ! 
there's no sweat-inducing motion of the ocean here-- just two hours of shaky handheld camera work and a handful of cross-cut exteriors , all leading up to the big slam , when the love boat sideswipes an oil tanker and then plows into a harbor town . 
 ( oh , how far we've come in twenty years . 
remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak ? ) 
admittedly , either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission . 
it's just the rest of the movie-- the other hundred or so minutes-- that's pure nonsense . 
and wonderful nonsense at that . 
i know he didn't intend to , but de bont has done one thing right : he's created the hands-down funniest film of the year . 
so , now , allow to present a few more things that made me laugh : 
o a box with a big label : "" fiber optic converter "" 
o plain english , whole-sentence computer instructions 
o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door 
o jason patric's character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that's happening 
o a ships' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say "" i canna override it ! "" 
o willem dafoe's amazing arm-mounted keyboard 
o two living , breathing adults ( bullock's character and the first mate ) who have to be told , step by step , how to disconnect a trip wire from the pin of a hand grenade . 
duh 
o "" no wait ! "" 
screams the ship's intercom 
o yet another damn dog in peril 
o fishing reel .

memories of weekend at bernie's 
"
neg	"and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year . 
turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts . 
it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . 
for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . 
for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all . 
 "" end of days "" is a major stinker . 
the movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . 
some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . 
if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . 
the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . 
in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . 
twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem . 
now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . 
an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . 
recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . 
there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? 
casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . 
schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . 
arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . 
in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . 
harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . 
there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back . 
none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task . 
the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . 
this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him . 
the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . 
as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident . 
he acts like one would expect the devil to act . 
the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . 
byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . 
byrne's speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" 'tis not ! "" 
variety ) are feeble at best . 
the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . 
kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . 
robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared . 
in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . 
performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . 
this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous . 
why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ? 
because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out . 
some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 ! 
if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone . 
it's convoluted and silly at the same time . 
the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . 
 . 
 . ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all . 
why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ? 
is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? 
how come he can't control jericho or christine ? 
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? 
a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it's never actually explained . 
usually , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don't get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . 
there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in "" end of days , "" complete with the old "" black cat hiding in a cabinet "" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . 
it gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a "" boo "" will come . 
their predictions will rarely be wrong . 
the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don't care about these characters ( due to the script's pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don't make any sense . 
there's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . 
it's good for a few chuckles , but not much else . 
supposedly we're to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . 
none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it's often hard to tell why it's happening in the first place , not to mention that they're edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style . 
most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , "" wow , cool ! "" 
 "" end of days "" is not only silly and confusing , but it's also distinctly unpleasant to watch . 
the devil apparently doesn't operate in the more subtle , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . 
this doesn't only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in "" end of days "" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . 
if violence is supposed to be shocking , it's not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . 
scenes aren't connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . 
reasons ? 
to hell with reasons ! 
let's just blow stuff up ! 
isn't it cool ? 
nope , not by a long shot . 
this film is thoroughly unwatchable . 
it's dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . 
perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it's not happening with hack peter hyams here . 
 "" end of days "" might have had camp value , if only it didn't top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody's going to buy . 
if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . 
if it's going to be campy , arnold shouldn't be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn't actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn't be such a sad sack . 
as it stands , "" end of days "" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that . 
"
neg	"america's favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in "" bride of chucky , "" and their unholy matrimony is something old , nothing new . 
the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers , however , has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up , but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood-soaked honeymoon . 
the answer is a sick-and-twisted yes - and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot-enough-to-melt-rubber ( or at least singe it ) lovin' . 
guess they're anatomically correct . 
chucky ( again voiced by brad dourif ) , of course , is the star of the "" child's play "" series , a my buddy-type doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer . 
in "" bride , "" the plot ( heh ) picks up with his girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) resurrecting chucky's remains ( he was blown up at the end of "" child's play 3 "" ) with the help of a black arts manual called "" voodoo for dummies . "" 
silly mortal . 
before long , she's also been reduced to shin-high figurine status , and the plastic incarnations of these one-time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies . 
the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young couple ( nick stabile and katherine heigl ) with conjugal plans of their own , leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical , soul-transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait . 
along the way , our murderous barbie and ken go through post-marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds - bicker , argue , kiss and make up . 
but when they squabble over who's going to do the dishes , watch out . 
hey , even faux people have got to work through their problems . 
director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two , but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing . 
when one of them charges , it's nothing a good forward punt couldn't take care of . 
and when a climactic chase scene is needed , one of the dim-bulb protagonists must _pick_chucky_up_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint . 
throw in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending ( will "" son of chucky "" be next ? ) and this is a bizarrely bad 89-minutes at the movies . 
as is the thing to do in post- "" scream "" slasher cinema , don mancini's screenplay slathers on the in-jokes and genre-parody . 
but little of the humor succeeds , proving self-reference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite . 
to be fair , though , most of "" bride of chucky "" is on auto-pilot , so it's not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film . 
similarly shaky , the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland , the effects aren't that special and the story is one big groaner . 
here's hoping chucky and his entire clan - past , present and future - rest in peace .

neg	"steve martin is one of the funniest men alive . 
if you can take that as a true statement , then your disappointment at this film will equal mine . 
martin can be hilarious , creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters . 
you won't find any of them here . 
the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit . 
bilko ( and the name isn't an accident ) is the head of an army motor pool group , but his passion is his schemes . 
every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair-brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base . 
 "" mchale's navy "" 's granddaddy . 
that's the idea behind this movie too , but the difference is that , as far-fetched and usually goofy as the television series was , it was funny . 
there is not one laugh in the film . 
the re-make retains the goofiness , but not the entertainment . 
everything is just too clean . 
it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it . 
it all looks brand new , even the old beat-up stuff . 
martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role . 
in the original , phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness . 
martin's bilko is a pale imitation . 
the only semi-bright spot is phil hartman as bilko's arch-enemy . 
it's not saying much , considering martin's lackluster character , but hartman leaves him in the dust . 
"
neg	"senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far . 
director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . 
marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . 
however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . 
in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . 
but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . 
he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university's dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . 
as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . 
using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) . 
naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor . 
the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here . 
the film has it's one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . 
there obviously wasn't much thought put into the plot . 
the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . 
i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? 
and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? 
to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl's roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . 
apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . 
his "" intervention "" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . 
and then there's the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . 
in this case , the object of darryl's amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won't have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses . 
needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . 
this is a film that desperately needed something else . 
be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . 
as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground . 
"
neg	"here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter . 
these kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen . 
that is not to say that i don't like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven't a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags . 
observe the opening sequence . 
a band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) . 
they are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles . 
however , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut . 
he is undecided . 
this happens for about 10 seconds . 
the audience finds some humor in his foolishness . 
the lights suddenly go out . 
cisco is surprised and says : "" whoa . . . let's 
go ! "" 
and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence . 
the big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film . 
needing cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi . 
however , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco's and melvin's boss . 
infuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping . 
during his 'investigation' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution . 
melvin must now find a way to stay alive . 
by the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ? 
cisco's partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing . 
but , mr . nishi has a trace buster buster . 
to counter that , cisco's partner has a trace buster buster buster . 
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster . 
and so on . . . 
there is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live . 
and there are lots of issues that we'd like to know more about . 
how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee ? 
what goes on among this clique ? 
why is cisco at odds with melvin ? 
there is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored , but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction , and instead we are given a not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners , silly sight gags , extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery . 
and , i haven't even mentioned his financee's visiting parents who want them to separate , nor melvin's mistress , nor the pimple-faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on . 
if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now .

neg	"here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . 
now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is . 
all sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . 
van damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . 
van damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . 
the remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . 
once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . 
jean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie . 
in other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . 
on the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . 
sadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . 
she is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species . 
this is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . 
nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie . 
simply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . 
it has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins . 
he still can't act . 
we all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) . 
this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par . 
"
neg	"five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king's writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king . 
unlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore . 
plot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers . 
critique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional "" evil "" characters . 
its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles . 
the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about . 
of course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be "" misunderstood "" , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified . 
and let's not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) . 
am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ? 
or even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat's ass about anyone in this film ? 
well , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin . 
furthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story . 
in fact , the story is empty within itself . 
i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not . 
wow . 
how interesting . 
the plot's utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) . 
whip out those thinking caps , kids ! 
hmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter "" evil "" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity . 
hmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls . 
what a crock ! 
i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging . 
in fact , it was one big bore . 
i didn't see the point of the movie , i didn't see the point of the story and i certainly didn't see the point in tom hanks' big double-chin . 
all in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey . 
give that man an award or something !

neg	"alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam's adventure "" the musketeer . "" 
for some reason that i may figure out later , i don't know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of "" the musketeer . "" 
it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film's xin-xin xiong ( "" once upon a time in china "" ) and yuen woo-ping from "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon . "" 
the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well . 
elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 "" the three musketeers "" ) , the man with no name from "" a fistful of dollars "" ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano . 
the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the "" matrix "" crowd . 
alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters . 
the real problem with the "" the musketeer "" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) . 
chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma . 
suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen . 
if "" the musketeer "" makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons . 
stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one . 
the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive . 
catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in "" the princess bride ) . 
stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character . 
tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal's chief henchman , febre . 
he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout . 
the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan's aid when needed . 
peter hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well . 
a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps . 
photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan's folks years before . 
it is all routine stuff . 
the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse . 
it works in a sci-fi film like "" the matrix "" or in a classical fantasy like "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" but just calls attention to itself in "" the musketeer . "" 
at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used . 
it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed . 
with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d .

neg	"synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . 
the brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . 
meanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . 
comments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? 
it's hard to speculate . 
most of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . 
in case you haven't picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel "" thriller "" ( i use the term "" thriller "" loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad . 
the plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . 
writing a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . 
there's really not much to say . 
the acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience . 
most humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist's agent . 
he is so horrible in this role that one can't help but be amused . 
the plot sucks . 
nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . 
the dialogue stinks . 
a loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn't need to know . 
everything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits . 
as the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being "" assistsant to foley artist . "" 
someone could have used an editor ! 
to be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes . 
playboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here . 
i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie . 
why did i give this turkey two stars and not one ? 
as a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film . 
if you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i'd recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else . 
"
neg	"in a typical cinematic high school , the football jocks have sex with the girls and then dump them , but not before the boys' scores are dutifully recorded in their little black books . 
as the sexual acts take place , the other guys hang out nearby , guzzling beer and grunting like pigs . 
in the rage : carrie 2 , robert mandel's terminally bland sequel to carrie , there isn't a single original moment . 
only amy irving returns from carrie , and the talent of the rest of the sequel's cast is impossible to determine given the stupefying mediocrity of rafael moreu's script . 
as rachel , the horror story's lead , emily bergl gives one of the least scary performances in recent memory , but it isn't exactly her fault . 
the director asks for little from his actors , which is precisely what he gets . 
sporadically in this lame and lifeless movie , rachel will cause school lockers and windows to fly open , but generally she just mopes around looking like a victim . 
her fellow students delight in tormenting her . 
of course , she will get her revenge in the obligatory ending bloodbath in which she will decapitate and castrate the boys and crush the girls with burning timbers . 
as the movie marks time until its big finale , it throws in some repugnant scenes , hoping to turn audience's stomachs . 
rachel's girlfriend commits a horrible and realistic suicide after the boy who made "" love "" to her the night before spurns her . 
 ( he gets major points in his black book for this , but his buddies say he would have gotten more if he had had sex with her after her death . ) 
even a helpless puppy is run over , and we see his poor , little body flipping over and over under a truck . 
the teenagers in the movie are completely blas ? about it all . 
 "" doesn't it offend you that some girl offed herself yesterday , "" asks one of the few kids with a conscience . 
 "" why ? "" 
responds his nonplussed girlfriend . 
 "" she wasn't anybody . "" 
remarkably devoid of any energy , especially for a horror flick , the movie makes one yearn for a fast forward button on the theater's armrest . 
with material this bad , the film's only hope is to go for parody , but it isn't smart enough to realize it . 
even the mandatory epilogue is as pointless and predictable as the rest of the movie . 
the rage : carrie 2 runs 1 : 45 . 
it is rated r for graphic violence , teen alcohol abuse , sex , nudity and profanity and would be acceptable only for older teenagers .

neg	"toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes . 
this carl "" apollo creed "" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs . evil establishment crook , and relies on all the '80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer . 
somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs . 
weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques . 
speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson's superior yells , "" you tore his arm off ! "" 
jackson replies , "" he had a spare . "" 
jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson . 
after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , "" i take it you're not one of dellaplane's friends . "" 
 "" not unless they changed the definition , "" jackson glowers . 
and of course it turns out stone is mrs . dellaplane . 
faux pas , jackson . . . 
not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa . 
it's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) . 
wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson . 
she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane's nightclub . 
after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , "" i expected a standing ovation . "" 
he responds , "" you're getting one , "" and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the time . 
prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs . . . 
or at least the prince . 
it's a testament to the '80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie . 
action jackson is another variation on the "" unlikely partners "" buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around . 
this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they're given , there's not much room for improvement . 
my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , "" i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head . "" 
jackson's response is , "" i think i felt that way once . 
they called it love . "" 
you'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk . 
serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !

neg	"hollywood never fails to astound me . 
every time i think those coked-up little buggers have hit rock bottom ; they come up with a new excavating tool . 
i was truly convinced that "" wild wild west "" marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless , but then along comes "" end of days "" to prove me wrong . 
this big budget , brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music , grisly violence , explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects . 
the result ? 
nothing but groans and yawns . 
even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept . 
at the very least , "" end of days "" should have done us the courtesy of being bad-enough-to-be-good , but it can't even manage that . 
it's just lousy . 
arnold schwarzenegger , still recovering from heart problems and "" batman & robin , "" plays an ex-cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something . 
along with his obligatory comic relief partner ( kevin pollak , impersonating matthew perry's chandler character from "" friends "" ) , he gets involved in some major league supernatural hoodoo . 
it seems that satan ( gabriel byrne ) gets a shot at world domination only once every thousand years ( and here i thought he'd pulled it off with the republican landslide of '94 ) . 
if he has sex with 20-year old christine york ( robin tunney ) , "" the chosen one , "" their child will be the antichrist , or at least a brat . 
ah , but this deal has more catches than a new year's eve pass from a halfway house . 
the unholy union must take place on december 31 , 1999 ( you see , 999 is just 666 turned upside down ) , but only between 11 p . m . and midnight ( no wonder this guy is so cranky ) . 
and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church , the devil won't know where she is , because he can't see into the sanctuary . 
you know , it's kind of like superman's x-ray vision and lead walls , only evil . 
a group of guerrilla catholic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl . 
arnold chooses to save the girl and kick the hell out of satan , if you'll pardon the expression . 
and kevin meets up with an exploding van and has to make some decisions of his own . 
oh , the anguish ! 
oh , the humanity ! 
oh , the writing ! 
andrew w . marlowe's screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility , from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his handling of jericho cane , schwarzenegger's character . 
cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first "" lethal weapon , "" preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife and daughter . 
twenty minutes later , he's racing through the bowels of new york city , deciphering clues that sherlock holmes and kreskin would find baffling . 
when cane meets up with christine york , he instantly switches to terminator father figure mode , with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter . 
in case anyone misses the connection , the camera comes in for a close up of christine's music box , which just happens to be identical to one owned by cane's daughter . 
subtle , marlowe , subtle . 
speaking of cameras , director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe's script and make it even more self-important , murky and annoying . 
hyams' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video , with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces , punctuated with loads of big explosions . 
eager to satisfy arnold's core audience , he even throws in a few pairs of breasts as well . 
what a guy . 
had the film delivered some decent scares , or even maintained a consistently ominous tone , the bombastic clich ? s might have been tolerable , but "" end of days "" is simply a flaccid special effects show . 
the cast is just as ineffective . 
in his early scenes , gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache , but he all too soon turns into just another standard issue monster . 
kevin pollak comes and goes quickly , robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder and as for arnold , well ? he's a better actor than casper van dien . 
that should count for something . 
way back in the aftermath "" the exorcist "" and "" the omen , "" supernatural swill like "" end of days "" might have passed muster as a b-movie . 
but that was then and this is now . 
 "" the x-files "" and "" buffy the vampire slayer "" deliver real scares on a weekly basis and , if we want to see the devil , all we have to do is flip on "" the 700 club "" and take a gander at pat robertson's grinning maw . 
after enduring "" end of days , "" all i can say is "" get thee behind me , satan . 
and while you're at it , get thee a better agent as well . "" 
"
neg	"this is your definitive "" hollywood "" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn't used enough here ) , i'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . 
in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . 
while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . 
over money ( how original ) . 
while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . 
now she has learned about a law titled "" double jeopardy "" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . 
now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . 
skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . 
but she's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . 
as i'd said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . 
he was much more of a supporting character . 
which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . 
i feel this film had alot going for it . 
originality not being an issue . 
the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . 
the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . 
the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . 
i was just left unsatisfied in the long run . 
so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . 
keep this in mind , if you're in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive .

neg	"there's a good , and timely , story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first , a new movie about the abuses of our prison system . 
with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy , this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies--a point of view . 
but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious , often nauseating , camera movements and slick , mtv- style lighting and editing are far more important . 
there's not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling . 
and everything suffers . 
christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate , respectively . 
after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape , bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial . 
his young lawyer ( slater ) is fresh out of law school but determined to "" put alcatraz on trial "" for the abuses of it warden ( gary oldman ) . 
the result is the usual courtroom theatrics- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students . 
there's very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon's earnest overacting and the appropriate story . 
there's a lot of overacting from everyone--you know you're in trouble right away when r . lee ermey ( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket ) is cast as a judge , the center of reason and moderation . 
slater has never been convincing and certainly isn't here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances . 
but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story . 
there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters , let alone with them . 
how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions . 
if there's anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world , it is our ability to tell a good story . 
have we forgotten ?

neg	"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience . 
being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take . 
thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 . 
plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing . 
too late . 
this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it . 
i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm . 
consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral . 
imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2 . 
 ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals . 
 ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy . 
 ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute . 
 ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition . 
 ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig . 
that'll do . "" 
now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script ) . 
 ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget ) . 
out . 
e . g . 
daily comes in with noticable results . 
 ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 ) . 
 ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_ . 
babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again . 
 ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired ) . 
season now with the "" original "" elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin . 
 ( i ) change the venue into "" the big city "" . 
this has been praised as wildly original . 
excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ? 
how about the muppets ? 
even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo . 
sorry . 
no dice . 
side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive . 
but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions . 
and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_ . 
 ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by "" the boss' wife "" played by magda szubanski . 
s-t-r-e-t-c-h . 
she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls . 
 ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges ! 
have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes ! 
have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! ) 
i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in . 
i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater . 
even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated . 
no . . . my problem is with the story , or lack thereof . 
_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but once in the city , that story is forgotten . 
being a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice , but , other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull , what did babe actually _do_ ? 
without giving the ending away , the farm is saved from a left-field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig . 
speaking of "" pig "" , or , "" pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! "" . 
the word "" pig "" is so overused , had they changed it to an expletive , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watching _scarface_ . 
this is screenwriting ? 
further , i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups . 
had it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd , maybe my reaction would have been softened . 
but to farmer hoggett ? 
his wife ? 
an elderly mickey rooney ? 
much too irreverent . 
 ( "" quick ! 
splice those singing mice into those scenes ! "" ) . 
the film isn't a colossal failure . 
i did like glenne headley's schmoozy chimpanzee . 
i liked the pink poodle . 
the dog on the cart , who momentarily thinks he's in dog heaven . 
and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly-cast as an airport employee and a judge . 
but most of the time , i was looking down , in boredom , or in embarrassment over the hacked-up script . 
them singing mice , those chapter partitions , the proficient acting of the animals-- none of these can compensate for a story . 
let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett looks at pig , proud , says "" that'll do , pig . 
that'll do . "" 
that's it . 
hope i didn't ruin it for you . 
but tell me this : what the heck did that pig _do_ ? 
"
neg	"the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . 
one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . 
under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . 
the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . 
in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . 
almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail . 
everyone salutes . 
it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right . 
that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . 
in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . 
what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right . 
the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . 
paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . 
prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . 
so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers ) . 
brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges . 
he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . 
what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . 
it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky . 
does the arms subplot turn up later ? 
no , so why add this extra running time to the film ? 
the answer : it looked cool . 
or how about the "" atmosphere "" ? 
the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . 
nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . 
no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . 
did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? 
instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . 
the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . 
as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . 
brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i've ever heard . 
he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . 
sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . 
both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . 
i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , "" let's do it again , but this time , i want more . "" 
i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . 
an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler . 
i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . 
a far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction . 
a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . 
the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . 
woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . 
hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn't overacting . 
i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . 
the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . 
every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . 
instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . 
the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . 
would've been over in a half hour . 
the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . 
literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . 
they both seem kind of happy . 
maybe they were driving away from simon west .

neg	"she was the femme in "" la femme nikita . "" 
he was the baldwin in "" backdraft , "" "" sliver , "" and "" fair game "" ( with cindy crawford ) . 
together , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make "" shattered image "" the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone "" thriller "" "" the specialist . "" 
the film poses the question "" what if the life you're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? "" 
it's either about a woman who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's a hired assassin , or it's about a hired assassin who's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica . 
it doesn't much matter and believe me by the time "" shattered image "" runs its painful and pedestrian course you won't care . 
these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it's now * twice * as boring as it might have been . 
it's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining . 
of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style . 
 "" shattered image "" isn't complex , it's just stupid . 
and boring . 
parillaud and baldwin , who aren't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines . 
lines like : 
 "" you don't beg , you insist . 
i like that in a woman . "" 
that's parillaud's character talking . . . 
to her cat ! 
and : 
 "" you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you . "" 
huh ? 
and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film : 
 "" if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you . "" 
 "" i don't have that kind of time . "" 
talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say "" point of no return . "" 
we have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first . 
but there's nothing to learn . 
karen is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone's-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer . 
siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film's meaningless stock title . 
baldwin seems more interested in parillaud's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her . 
each time graham greene shows up he gets killed . 
barbet schroeder ( "" reversal of fortune "" ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself . 
every now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie . 
and every now and again , as "" shattered image "" makes agonizingly clear , it isn't . 
"
neg	"all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . 
ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . 
but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . 
no number of name changes can help this picture . 
it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . 
hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . 
the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . 
the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . 
from that moment on , it's all downhill . 
whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . 
it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . 
basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . 
there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . 
it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . 
the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . 
action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . 
graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . 
unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . 
the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . 
we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . 
the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . 
the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . 
there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . 
he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's "" lou grant "" ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river . 
a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . 
after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . 
as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . 
there isn't any real acting in this film . 
christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . 
tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . 
randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . 
morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . 
freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . 
following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict . 
as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . 
titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . 
hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . 
thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . 
fortunately , there are only two elements left . 
"
neg	"disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand . 
there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide . 
richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) . 
once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise . 
this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel . 
the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking . 
i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning . 
but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography . 
though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking . 
the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts . 
this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better . 
now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise . 
this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable . 
there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) . 
i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me . 
the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child . 
although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher . 
the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does . 
the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough . 
richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line . 
this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused . 
now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) . 
the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard . 
mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better . 
which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ? 
 ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) . 
but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible . 
the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable . 
not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense . 
when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable . 
i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story . 
as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt . 
if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings . 
"
neg	"the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music . 
it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea . 
however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged . 
unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original . 
the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended . 
elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died . 
as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together . 
john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable . 
first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) . 
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band . 
next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band . 
finally , there's buster ( j . 
evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band . 
the plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it 
seems to be almost a clone of the original . 
elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale . 
the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role . 
in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original . 
remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ? 
well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music . 
there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat . 
there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) . 
there are plenty of recurring characters too . 
in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy . 
frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden . 
as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy . 
aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood . 
john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack . 
joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab . 
and what's the deal with the orphan ? 
it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film . 
at least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role . 
but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music . 
and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) . 
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable . 
to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances . 
b . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there . 
unfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot . 
if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks . 
it's a shame . 
buy the soundtrack and avoid the film . 
better yet , rewatch the original . . . you'll 
have a much better time .

neg	"the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from "" l . a . confidential "" to "" palmetto "" to "" the big lebowski , "" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors . 
with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir . 
 "" wild things "" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture . 
overacted , overwrought and overlong , "" wild things "" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too . 
with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness . 
in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , "" wild things "" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical . 
directed by john mcnaughton ( "" henry : portrait of a serial killer "" ) , "" wild things "" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community . 
particularly one . 
kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner . 
soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house . 
next thing , she cries rape . 
and the so-called "" roller-coaster ride "" ensues . 
a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen . 
even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer . 
he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray . 
you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role . 
as ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie . 
the community is astonished . 
reporters flee to the scene . 
there's an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) . 
there's the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust . 
we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful . 
like so many thrillers these days , including "" the usual suspects "" and "" the game , "" "" wild things "" eschews character for plot . 
mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany "" henry , "" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force . 
george clinton's score is a delight to behold . 
but it's the humans . 
the characters are mere devices for the "" nasty "" twists . 
what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don't feel real or we don't care for them . 
not even the unintentionally funny moments work . 
the people in "" wild things "" are not so much people as they are caricatures . 
then there's the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois . 
and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon's member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go . 
ironically , the wildest elements of "" wild things "" are not wild at all . 
"
neg	"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes . 
the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . 
unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . 
as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . 
it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . 
during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . 
the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . 
we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . 
we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . 
we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . 
no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . 
i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . 
the movie cuts again , this time to the present . 
the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . 
we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . 
steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . 
tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . 
she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . 
 ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . 
how did i know ? 
because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) 
the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . 
they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . 
kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . 
presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained . 
the party of five heads off into the woods as promised . 
they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events . 
there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . 
the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . 
sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . 
this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . 
the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . 
the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! "" 
ooh . 
spooky . 
the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . 
they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . 
wacky hijinks ensue . 
tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . 
throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . 
when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . 
 ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . 
okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , 
nevermind . ) 
this movie was awful . 
simply awful . 
the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . 
erica is the nature-loving wiccan . 
tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . 
steven is the overbearing asshole . 
kim is the antisocial goth girl . 
old , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . 
how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? 
because she's pregnant ! 
how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? 
because she wears a lot of eye makeup ! 
how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? 
because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of "" deliverance "" ! 
this is weak storytelling at its worst . 
rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . 
it didn't work . 
on top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . 
 ( "" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . 
let's get on a plane home . "" 
 "" no . 
i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on . "" 
 "" ok . "" ) 
frankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . 
i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film . 
the first movie worked by never showing us the horror . 
the witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . 
the horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . 
this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . 
blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . 
this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . 
knives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . 
this movie didn't stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . 
by the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . 
it is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . 
i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . 
i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no "" monster , "" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . 
i found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director's intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . 
 ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . 
and if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? 
the snowfall of manuscript paper ? 
hm ? ) 
blair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . 
from the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through . 
"
neg	"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . 
some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . 
both those films were tense exercises in chills . 
the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . 
but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . 
for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . 
each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . 
they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . 
the thrills all came from the plot . 
ronin is like a film made by another man . 
somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . 
we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . 
the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . 
when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . 
if you miss the opening , do not worry . 
this film will explain again what a ronin is . 
sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . 
he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . 
he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . 
sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . 
dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . 
sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . 
also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . 
the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . 
their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . 
the story is not very easy to follow . 
it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . 
somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . 
some very good actors are involved in this film . 
one wonders what they saw in the script . 
the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . 
they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . 
by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . 
maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . 
in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . 
as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . 
unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . 
i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . 
also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . 
this is the first blow of the 47 ronin .

neg	"the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film . 
since june , i haven't been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha's "" take on me "" in his yellow miata . 
why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? 
honestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie . 
man , was i wrong . 
corky romano is one of those throwaway , clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots . 
fortunately for chris kattan's precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety . 
kattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny '80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans ( "" you don't have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps . "" ) . 
when his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges , his bungling , lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent , black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence . 
predictably , hijinks ensue . 
if the basic plot sounds bad , wait until you get into the inner-workings of this clunker . 
the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity . 
corky's fbi agent identity is named corky pissant ( "" that's pronounced pees-ahn . 
it's french . "" ) . 
he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom . 
and not a good sitcom , i mean . 
the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other's face . 
and in a scene taken straight from there's something about mary , corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . 
but it's not a complete disaster . 
the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments , including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren , a german shephard , and a kilo of cocaine . 
plus , berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie . 
and , it's nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work . 
unfortunately for those out there who can't truly appreciate animal or fart jokes , corky won't have much to offer you . 
so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv , asking , "" who is corky ? "" 
you can simply reply , "" who cares ? "" 
"
neg	"in this year's summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as "" a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . "" 
one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements . 
the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness . 
it's a large family , but there's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio . 
jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family , but she's kind of a hypocrite since she's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) . 
her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration . 
also , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy , sexy jadzia ? 
hala is a spoiled , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy . 
with such an unappealing set of characters , it's no surprise that _polish_wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving . 
naturally , jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop , russell schuster ( adam trese ) , who fathered the child , but he refuses to make such a commitment . 
ho-hum . 
another complication , involving the decidedly un-virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary , is first played for laughs and then , inexplicably , as a profound statement in the film's climax--which , ironically , is funnier than any of the film's lame attempts at humor , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell . 
that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly . 
the jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers . 
the hala-russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived a manner , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something . 
and then there's some atrocious dialogue , which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound : "" look at all these pickles . 
just looking at them gives me such great sadness . "" 
as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is , the affair is something of a letdown , considering the strong performances by byrne , danes , and especially the fiery olin . 
they obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share . 
"
neg	"it seemed like the perfect concept . 
what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? 
it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . 
jim carrey's signed on too ? 
even better . 
the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth . 
such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . 
yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny . 
it's not for lack of trying . 
the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . 
this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . 
soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . 
this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . 
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . 
some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work . 
they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary . "" 
 ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project . ) 
the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . 
in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . 
 "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . 
having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment . 
the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . 
but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . 
the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go . 
 ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? 
yeah , me too . ) 
the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . 
compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross . 
the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . 
take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . 
the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . 
but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either . 
that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . 
 "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities . 
there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions . 
this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it . 
the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . 
jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me . "" 
it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . 
carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way . 
perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . 
zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . 
irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither . 
as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film . 
chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . 
he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . 
after viewing the shapeless mess that "" me , myself & irene "" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . 
maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . 
but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . 
if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine . 
even after that happens , though , i'll still consider "" me , myself & irene "" to be a high-caliber misfire .

neg	"deserves recognition for : making this relatively youthful critic feel extremely old and crotchety20 
capsule review : this is what feel-good family entertainment has morphed into in the 90's : an hour-and-a-half commercial , disguised as an unnecessary remake , in which the defining image is that of a grown man launching a volume of green protoplasmic goo out of his ass . 
 ( between this , rocketman , and george of the jungle , disney has recently eclipsed longtime champion troma as the studio most likely to include a fart joke in a film . ) 
as the absent-minded professor who invents the titular computer-generated goop , a listless robin williams manages the difficult task of making original lead fred macmurray seem sprightly . 
the only thing that made this film borderline tolerable for me is my newly-founded but firm belief that writer/producer john hughes is going to spend his eternal afterlife being conked in the noggin by all of the different blunt instruments he's used for comedic effect in films like this and the odious home alone series . 
take your kids to see boogie nights instead . 
"
neg	"you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing . . . and 
it's not a comedy ! 
and what a strange career path for director chuck russell . 
he starts his career off with a decent take on the "" nightmare on elm street "" series with his debut as director on installment number three . 
he follows that up with the blob the very next year , but waits another six years to do his next piece , a little film called the mask starring jim carrey , and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that . 
so then he thought , "" let me wait another five years , get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes "" ? ! ? 
strange dude and one crappy flick . 
plot : a six-year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god . 
a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl's aunt wants to . . . well , 
save her from those damn devil worshippers ! 
enter one occult expert agent , plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying , and you've just about got the gist of things here . 
critique : with plot holes the size of my ass , this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ? -ridden plot , with wasted talent , cheezy effects , bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot . 
what's good about this movie ? 
well , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children's shelter/satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around . 
the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn't really do all that much . 
and believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film's first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film's entire basis of believability . 
for some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes . . . is 
a dumb one ! 
add that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ? 
at least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you've got yourself a pretty bad movie . 
and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ? 
did they owe the director a favor or something ? 
together , they barely have five minutes of screen time , but i suppose that ricci's hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn-dogs . 
the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending , which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of "" sneaking up "" on a man's house , who they know to be guilty of a crime ! 
uuuhmm . . . how's 
about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass , officers ? ! 
anyway , i don't usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof ( and there was plenty to go around ) . 
and did basinger lose some of her acting "" talent "" during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ? 
difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad , or if she just delivered them poorly . 
either way , little originality , very obvious computer effects , little thrills , little drama and very little entertainment value , certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film . 
but if you really don't mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and "" kid "" -based thrillers , and enjoy watching films that don't bring anything new to the table . . . well , 
drink some beers , smoke some beans and rent this video , because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year . 
"
neg	"a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines , high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists . 
in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles , not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character . 
living in a world of heroin induced highs , they float along until they fall in love with each other . 
this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant . 
24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine "" frame . "" 
although the receptionist is impressed , syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) . 
for her to do photos for "" frame , "" lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her since lucy fancies her . 
lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson . 
the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin . 
this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture . 
syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club . 
lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs , which apparently is funded by her mother . 
lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being "" pigeonholed , "" and , since her mother has money , we can only assume that that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses . 
a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical . 
that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . 
 "" your work has a cultural currency that is important now , "" is the artist-speak that the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine . 
when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd , her idea of a romantic line is , "" i want to get high with you . "" 
in lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand . 
and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene . 
this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions . 
in another movie , it might have worked , but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted . 
high art runs 1 : 36 . 
it is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age . 
"
neg	"this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed . 
but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead . 
annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again . 
she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line . 
they sacked him after he got sick . 
now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation . 
that actually is the whole storyline . 
speed 2 could do without dialogues . 
the movie is all about images and remarkable sound . 
i don't really know why this is called an action movie . 
except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies . 
first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie . 
then desaster strikes . 
sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around . 
i looked for the "" action "" but couldn't find it . 
most of the time she is part of the decoration . 
the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door . 
now we know that she can handle a chain saw . 
we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds . 
the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed . 
jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water . 
his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger . 
he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part . 
then there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster . 
he doesn't succeed , though . 
an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential . 
before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror . 
i can't really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny . 
especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat . 
there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie . 
in keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death . 
a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision . 
some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie . 
had they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them . 
those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects . 
in an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate . 
but the ilm special effects can't save the movie . 
for all the money they could have done better .

neg	" "" alcohol and drugs = bad . 
not alcohol and drugs = good . 
got it ? "" 
just when you though you've seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those 'deep , emotional stories about finding yourself' . . 
'28 days' is practically a visualization of the usual 'meaningful' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa-meetings . 
gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . 
for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end . 
this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . 
her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . 
such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister's ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone's house . 
this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court-ordered rehab . 
here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment . 
most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . 
the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . 
it is a classic cautionary tale . 
an echo . 
a big , fat and expensive clich ? . 
a shadow of last year's 'girl , interrupted' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like 'the cuckoo's nest' and 'trainspotting' . 
director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . 
for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama/comedy . 
jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . 
and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . 
isn't that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? 
even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . 
it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . 
but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . 
that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . 
 "" all you need to do is just say no "" , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . 
and that's how simple it is ! 
in fact i would rather watch 'lost in space' once again , than return to '28 days' . 
as for acting , it's acceptable , but hardly anything else . 
for sandra bullock it's an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than 'speed' . 
she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . 
dominic west shines as the source of gwenie's devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins' and steve buscemi's great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . 
although intellectually 'girl , interrupted' was a greater achievement , '28 days' is superior in its visual aspect . 
there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . 
the most important thing is that we've seen it before and it was a lot better . 
'clean and sober' , 'only when i laugh' , 'when a man loves a woman' , 'leaving las vegas' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . 
so what's the point ? 
in other words '28 days' doesn't contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . 
if you're caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you're standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch '28 days' . 
under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $8 and 103 minutes lost . 
"
neg	"way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad . 
one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance . 
after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his "" target "" . 
it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate . 
but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty . 
here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his "" look here , see "" glory . 
it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion . 
unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that . 
as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man . 
the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed . 
but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit . 
directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity . 
unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it . 
the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . 
it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . 
even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously "" dramatic "" . 
usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . 
nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . 
thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled . 
however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . 
or substance . 
it's just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . 
even the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like "" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction "" are clever . 
at one point caan laments "" need is the ultimate monkey "" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said "" love is like hippo ass "" . 
i've seen porno with better dialogue . 
and some with better plot lines too . 
but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . 
caan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . 
benicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . 
speaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . 
nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he's only kept around for his cold presence . 
taye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . 
for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . 
it's vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about "" faggots "" migrating to los angeles . 
you know the routine . 
the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . 
but those gun shots sure crack like thunder . 
just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry's fetishized smith and wesson . 
oh how far we've come . 
"
neg	"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . 
sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . 
and not a particularly good one at that . 
what went wrong ? 
mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool . 
early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . 
in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . 
prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . 
why ? 
i haven't the foggiest . 
i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . 
with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . 
it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . 
the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . 
god forbid . 
woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . 
still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . 
cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . 
between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . 
the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . 
sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . 
thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . 
they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . 
newton bats her eyes flirtatiously . 
cruise grins a little too slyly . 
the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . 
here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . 
he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's ) . 
sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial "" i'm the man ! "" 
charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . 
mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop . 
the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the "" symbolic "" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . 
we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . 
it isn't done any differently here . 
the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . 
he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie . 
the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . 
when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort . 
he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . 
i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers . 
in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . 
the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . 
the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . 
though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "" so you thought i was dead . . . "" . 
not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . 
what a hero ! 
you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot . 
my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do . 
the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next "" special "" effect . 
i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . 
nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it . 
as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . 
in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma's ( that film's director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo's non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . 
it's irrelevant in every sense , as is character . 
all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .

brit love story in the offing . 
effeminate , mild-mannered karl is about to take a beatng from a bunch of ruffians at school as he bathes himself under a shower , his genitals tucked between his legs in the manner of a posing transvestite . 
he is only just saved by prentice , who appears in all respects barring his protective attitude towards karl to be your average street-wise punk-in-the-making . 
the ensuing scene ends up with both boys being ridiculed and then unfairly expelled from the school . 
they do not see each other for another eighteen yeas . 
in that time , prentice has matured into a somewhat loveable , if brash and bull-heaed goon who screws up his jobs and relationships while gamely clinging onto perennial adolescence via lether jackets , motorcycles and punk rock music . 
karl , on the other hand , has grown up to become kim , a drabby , insecure woman who works as a verse writer for a greeting card company . 
chance brings the two together , and love , such as will inevitably blossom in your quirky british romantic comedy , is what this skewed little story is largely about . 
if at this point you think you're going to get any cheap laughs with that gender-bending theme ( see the birdcage , to wong foo . . . , priscilla queen of the desert ) , you can just go home and brood on your own maladjusted sexuality you low-life deadbeat . 
kim is a post-operative transsexual , thank you very much . . . 
a new-born woman for all purposes , with confusions and sensitivities that deserve treatment with a touch of delicacy . 
personally , give me those cheap laughs any day . 
i'd rather enjoy obvious camp than endure the shallow exploration of a soft- hearted transsexual love story . 
different for girls comes up with a promising enough proposition , but does nothing that surpasses the merely workmanlike with it . 
by refusing to make the audience really uncomfortable with the notion of kim and prentice's relation- ship , or at the very least feel uncomfortable for them ( prentice for example , doesn't seem to give hiself all that much grief when he becomes attracted to kim despite being a fight-picking , beer-drinking , macho kind of guy , and kim , for all her insecurities and fears is always saved any truly disturbing victimisation in the film ) , and instead drawing them into a basically wimpy love story , the film manages to lobotomise itself . 
lightweight comedy as it's doomed to be , it could've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple . 
but this doesn't either , since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh's kim foyle , and as either sex , he's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like . 
prentice does though , and that's never explained . 
but then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there's no reason to explain why he's so screwed up . 
if oddly enough you grow to like this show , you'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film won't fail you there either . 
snide underling at kim's office gets her come-uppance . 
misogynistic police officer who beats up prentice gets his come-uppance . 
the couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim's apartment . 
kim's sister and her impotent sarge-type husband kiss and make up after a tiff ( tv movie sub-plot with incidental juxtaposition ) . 
and best of all , kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers , making prentice ride pilion . 
awwww . 
terrific closure . 
happy ending . 
but just what is it that's differnt for girls anyway ? 
if you figure that one out , let me know . 
the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .

 * * * pretty good , bring a friend .

neg	"the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . 
it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction . 
that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . 
the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . 
our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division . 
his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . 
complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . 
general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . 
teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid . 
if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems . 
scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . 
director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw . 
it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . 
characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . 
west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter . 
he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . 
bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . 
the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . 
there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . 
indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : "" shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? "" ) . 
even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers . 
goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies . 
dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script . 
it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . 
by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . 
it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five . 
goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine .

neg	"are you like me ? 
do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places , shouting out loud , not giving a ratt's ass about anyone around them , and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ? 
well if you are , than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half . . . only to make up and hug in the end . 
aaaaaaaahhhh . . . 
plot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives , begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill . 
critique : this would be a good movie if it wasn't for the fact that it's got very little to say , features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations , is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special . 
and i'm being nice ! 
how junk like this gets made is beyond me , but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow , considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit . 
the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryan's character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot . 
wow . . . how 
deep . 
of course , the same christmas tune that's played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background , while characters continue to build "" bonds "" among one another by making reference to old , quaint movies or movie stars . 
stop me . . . i'm 
gonna cry again ! 
this film is a mess . 
the characters are boring and irritating to watch , the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot , kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways , while sharing an "" emotional "" moment about movie stars from the 50s . 
admittedly , i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes , but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film . 
meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot , looking as adorable as ever , but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range , cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that she's in . 
enough already ! 
and diane keaton must've spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one , cause her acting was amateurish at best . 
neither one convinced in "" emotional "" scenes . 
granted , they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and that's probably where my rating of three points comes from . 
all in all , this movie is not funny ( unless you're one to chuckle at train wrecks ) , provides zero drama ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving ) , generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note ( "" oh no , please don't get any flour on my donna karan dress ! ) . 
ugh . 
i suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something ! 
that'll teach 'em to mess with you ! 
oh and incidentally , mrs . joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind , so there ! 
then again . . . maybe 
you'll like it .

using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention , he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him . 
and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs . 
made on a pittance , the film features an almost exclusively asian-american cast . 
as directed by quentin lee and justin lin , the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films . 
jeanne chin plays katherine , a meek and soft-spoken wife , who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex . 
we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins , real and imagined , to her therapist . 
as her husband , jim , clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness . 
the picture is filled with stereotypes . 
there's a mysterious , loud-mouthed waitress with a big , platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she's a lesbian . 
she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer , a gay guy . 
and the lone white with a major role , the author on werewolfism , has wildly unkempt , orangey blonde , curly hair . 
from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist , the script rarely has anything to offer . 
the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad-libbing . 
one can only hope that the directors' next film will have some substance and some credible acting . 
shopping for fangs runs 1 : 30 . 
it is rated r for sex , violence , and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers .

bryan | brown . 
in a desert settlement , hundreds of kilometres from the nearest town , there is an uneasy calm between the local aboriginals and the handful of white settlers who live nearby . 
the local police officer has the task of enforcing "" white man's justice "" to the aboriginals . 
these are people with a proud 40 , 000 year heritage behind them . 
naturally , this includes their own system of justice ; key to which is "" payback "" . 
an eye for an eye . 
revenge . 
usually extracted by the spearing through of the recipient's thigh . 
brown , as the officer , manages quite well to keep the balance . 
he admits that he has to 'bend the rules' a bit , including actively encouraging at least one brutal "" payback "" . 
 ( be warned that this scene , near the start , is not for the squeamish ) . 
the local priest - an aboriginal , but in the "" white fellas "" church - has a foot on either side of the line . 
he is , figuratively and literally , in both camps . 
ernie dingo brings a great deal of understanding to this role as the man in the middle . 
he is part churchman and part politician . 
however the tension , like the heat , flies and dust , is always there . 
whilst her husband - the local teacher - is in church , white lady kate ( milliken ) and her aborginal friend tony , ( pedersen ) have gone off into the hills . 
he takes her to a sacred site , even today strictly men-only . 
she appears to not know this . 
tony tells her that this is a special place , an initiation place . 
he then makes love to her , surrounded by ancient rock art . 
the community finds out about this sacrilegious act and it's payback time . 
the fuse is lit and the brittle inter-racial peace is shattered . 
everyone is affected in the fall out . 
to say more is to give away the details of this finely crafted film . 
suffice to say it's a rewarding experience . 
bryan brown , acting and co-producing , is the pivotal character . 
his officer is real , human and therefore flawed . 
brown comments that he expects audiences to feel warmth towards the man , then suddenly feel angry about him . 
it wasn't long ago that i visited central australia - ayers rock ( uluru ) and alice springs - for the first time . 
the wide-screen cinematography shows the dead heart of australia in a way that captures it's vicious beauty , but never deteriorates into a moving slide show , in which the gorgeous background dominates those pesky actors in the foreground . 
the cultural clash has provided the thesis for many a film ; from the western to the birdcage . 
at least three excellent australian films have covered the aboriginal people and the line between them and we anglo-saxon 'invaders' : "" jedda "" , "" the chant of jimmie blacksmith "" and "" the last wave "" . 
in a year when the race 'debate' has reared up in australia , it is nourishing to see such an intelligent , non-judgemental film as "" dead heart "" . 
the aboriginal priest best sums this up . 
he is asked to say if he is a "" black fella or white fella "" . 
"
pos	"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . 
even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . 
on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . 
this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . 
the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . 
instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . 
although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime . 
amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much . 
every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . 
distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect . 
in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . 
after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . 
fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . 
even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . 
characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . 
every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions . 
because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . 
even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . 
when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . 
unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics . 
lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters . 
each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . 
fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . 
because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . 
fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . 
vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies . 
fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside . 
even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . 
on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . 
this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota . 
his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . 
that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .

pos	"with stars like sigourney weaver ( "" alien "" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . 
sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . 
helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . 
incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . 
a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . 
detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . 
copycat "" borrows "" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . 
but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . 
much of the time wasted could've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . 
even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . 
weaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . 
harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . 
which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . 
copycat is a good thriller . 
although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . 
this worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . 
nice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . .

pos	"i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . 
'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation' , the headlines read . 
intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . 
even though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . 
only now do i see the error of my ways . 
after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a "" holocaust comedy "" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . 
rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . 
roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . 
through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this "" beautiful princess "" , as he calls her . 
employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . 
life treats them well until hitler's minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son's innocence no matter what the sacrifice . 
granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a "" hogan's heros "" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . 
somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it's gravely serious subject . 
so , we've established that life is beautiful is not a "" holocaust comedy "" . 
but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . 
the film , despite critic's declarations of it being a "" triumph of the human spirit "" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . 
some have called the story an "" affirmation of the beauty of life "" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man's capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . 
the film's ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . 
essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . 
however , i am not denying the movie's greatness . 
believe me , it's fantastic . 
i'm just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . 
but perhaps i'm reading more into the movie than is really there . 
maybe the film's brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . 
in fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it .

pos	"garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men , who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there . 
shandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle . 
after a few disastrous "" mating "" attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won't have sex again until she gets married . 
the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the "" joys "" of married life . 
despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? 
is a very funny movie . 
the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well . 
the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead . 
but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive . 
plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? 
could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) . 
we never see anything though , it's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness . 
i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of "" less is more "" . 
the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film . 
annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) 
does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor . 
she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of "" high hopes "" for a lengthy period of time . 
ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino . . . 
good lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy . 
everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality . 
what planet are you from ? 
is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . 
the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions . 
also included on the disc as extras : a decent making-of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film's original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) . 
when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . 
how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it's own isolated track ? 
well as it turns out , it's a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review . 
kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc . 
what planet are your from ? 
was unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video . 
this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it .

pos	"robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood . 
paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross . 
harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight . 
when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in . 
soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust . 
there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon . 
james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends . 
stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest . 
reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend . 
giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain . 
with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze . 
luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony . 
twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot . 
it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days . 
the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber . 
however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable . 
the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn . 
stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher . 
there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe . 
it's a minor , but irritating , flaw . 
with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight . 
it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time . 
at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package . 
still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two .

pos	"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . 
[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] 
war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . 
movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . 
it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . 
forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number . 
 "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . 
it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing . 
the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . 
it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . 
spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . 
instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . 
there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . 
 "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . 
there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . 
we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . 
the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there . 
in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen . 
the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . 
they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . 
perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . 
the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil . "" 
the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . 
i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief . 
to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . 
one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . 
the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . 
tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . 
he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . 
he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . 
the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . 
through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously . 
when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . 
it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . 
but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . "" 
the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . 
his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . 
when miller's company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off . 
he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality . 
the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination , but not direction . 
along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . 
a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . 
the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors . 
the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . 
unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible . 
in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . 
although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . 
whether they're arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . 
sure , there's a zinger here and there , but war doesn't change the fact boys will be boys . 
if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . 
the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . 
private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? 
that's not a premise for thrills , it's symbolic of everything the film has worked for . 
it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . 
i remember reading a "" calvin & hobbes "" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , "" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? "" 
 "" saving private ryan "" is the adult version of that question .

pos	"'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses . 
see contact with your family . 
it is a movie for all ages . 
--a review by stuart cracraft 
contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star 
after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side . 
by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there . 
this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies . 
however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r . 
hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive . 
hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) . 
this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice . 
this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation . 
foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms . 
early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this . 
the movie's pacing is very good and subtle . 
the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful . 
the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however . 
one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation . 
there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored . 
it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters . 
everything else was very one-sided ( e . g . 
foster ) . 
lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table . 
the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega . 
it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory . 
in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens . 
the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction . 
but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster . 
freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast . 
as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her . 
it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably . 
the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump . 
in fact , zemeckis et . 
al . 
got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton . 
but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons . 
the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not . 
also , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing . 
contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe . 
perhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden .

pos	"matthew broderick and high school comedy . 
the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . 
now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . 
ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . 
it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . 
but election is far different . 
this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . 
jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . 
he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . 
in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . 
jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . 
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl . 
she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . 
so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . 
the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . 
the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . 
the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . 
and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . 
paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . 
tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . 
for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . 
he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . 
so paul agrees and the race is on . 
but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . 
her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . 
well , "" i don't even want to go to college , "" she says . 
in election , there are no "" good guys "" . 
almost everyone has their own agenda . 
no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . 
tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . 
she is the girl that would be labeled "" most likely to achieve anything she wants "" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . 
jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . 
everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters . 
that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . 
matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role . 
his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . 
of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior . 
but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . 
the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . 
broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . 
one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . 
you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . 
and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . 
the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . 
but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . 
however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . 
this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency . 
she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . 
if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . 
but don't you dare think that election's goals are similar . 
it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . 
there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here .

pos	"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic . 
postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . 
so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? 
my best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . 
no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . 
it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . 
to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . 
the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . 
but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies . 
there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . 
i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : 
the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . 
we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . 
bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . 
what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . 
we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . 
rose is to be wed to a man she does not love . 
we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . 
the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . 
add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . 
i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . 
she is a pleasure to see on screen . 
when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . 
the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . 
the effects are tremendous . 
from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . 
we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . 
my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . 
when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . 
titanic runs far too long . 
the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . 
and , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . 
don't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's 
not a bad as i am making it out to be . 
it really is an exceptionaly well-made film . 
the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . 
the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . 
this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . 
cameron has certainly made his best film to date . 
unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . 
it just doesn't have a strong supporting story . 
it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . 
it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . 
i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . 
it is a film worth seeing . 
i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . 
with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . 
this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . 
titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . 
i give titanic 3 stars ( . 
that's not bad .

pos	"a big surprise to me . 
the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope . 
they replaced him just fine . 
not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing . 
the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten . 
this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) . 
things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all . 
i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing . 
there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops . 
it's just the music . 
one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this . 
the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job . 
the only real problems i had was the special effects . 
these were superfluous and a waste of money . 
since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see . 
the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide .

pos	"capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen . 
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse . 
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet . 
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style . 
 , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) 
perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) 
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa . 
his films all seem to have one style , bleak . 
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold . 
little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver . 
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid . 
his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with . 
cure is probably his classic . 
last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon . 
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story . 
pulse is kurosawa back on form . 
taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software . 
two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment . 
taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software . 
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain . 
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself . 
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall . 
taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus . 
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide . 
but they are not entirely dead . 
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet . 
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost . 
if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow . 
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist . 
this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing "" like a computer disk . "" 
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses . 
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers . 
leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death . 
this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work . 
it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish . 
kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . 
frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . 
his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . 
junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone . 
images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . 
scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . 
people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . 
seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . 
kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . 
of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . 
i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
"
pos	"look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . 
some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . 
>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . 
perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . 
maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? 
film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject . 
the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . 
these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . 
however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . 
in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . "" 
while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . 
the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either . 
writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . 
the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . 
as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . 
that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . 
one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . 
the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . 
in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . 
on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . 
minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . 
in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . 
she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity . 
juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . 
on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . 
but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . 
one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . 
it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . 
paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . 
she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . 
john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . 
john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . 
only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . 
her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . 
one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . 
douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in . 
part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . 
on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . 
on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . "" 
but it's not all in the dialogue . 
mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . 
this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . 
the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . 
sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . 
for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .

pos	"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . 
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . 
i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . 
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . 
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through . 
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life . 
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . 
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before . 
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . 
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . 
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably . 
disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . 
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films . 
but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . 
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . 
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel . 
in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . 
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . 
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . 
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . 
but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . 
who will prevail ? 
time will tell , but i'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . 
this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story . 
but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version . 
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film . 
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . 
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . 
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . 
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . 
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . 
 "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million . . . "" he comments about his neglected childhood . 
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . 
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . 
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . 
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . 
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . 
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . 
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . 
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . 
meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . 
so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . 
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . 
however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . 
the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . 
there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . 
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . 
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . 
the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . 
visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline . 
but don't be fooled . . . 
little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it . 
after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . 
hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . 
as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . 
visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come . 
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity . 
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . 
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . 
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . 
however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe . 
it's truly a great example of film making at its finest . 
with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . 
the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . 
at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . 
do they ? ) . 
barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . 
young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . 
disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation . 
if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . 
vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story . 
in fact , it far exceeds that one . 
woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years . 
without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . 
in fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . 
sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . 
sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . 
after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . 
gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . 
christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . 
anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless . 
danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . 
dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . 
jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either . 
many people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman . 
he played miles on the tv show murphy brown . 
this is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses . 
of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also . 
directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . 
but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . 
tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . 
the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . 
kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . 
most of it will go over young children's heads . 
does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ? 
not at all . 
they will have a lot of fun watching this one . 
what is great is the themes that are given to us . 
part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . 
thankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects . 
antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . 
sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . 
the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . 
and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . 
but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . 
i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home . 
have i confused you enough ? 
if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most . 
"
pos	"there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . 
in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . 
all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . 
motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . 
the "" quilting bee "" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter . 
the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . 
she's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover . 
one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . 
from winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . 
the performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses . 
how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . 
there are probably too many characters . 
so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . 
we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . 
there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband . 
the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . 
there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . 
the stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . 
while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . 
there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . 
to put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't "" do much "" for me . 
on the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . 
finn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences . 
the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . 
if there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . 
"
pos	"let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal . 
so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal . 
i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times . 
under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix . 
this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet . 
the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age . 
in other words , the sound sucked . 
as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film . 
i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together . 
there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review . 
which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing . 
my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix . 
it is nothing short of stunning visually . 
sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good . 
the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked . 
keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax . 
it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster . 
now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network . 
the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed . 
the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose . 
that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons . 
they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie . 
reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . 
newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters . 
the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular . 
this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts . 
this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film . 
when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful . 
as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film . 
acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either . 
keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances . 
although to his credit , it is one of his better performances . 
laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film . 
more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama . 
joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had . 
carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role . 
it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks . 
you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film . 
it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences . 
i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times . 
in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird . 
it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie . 
so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about . 
thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability . 
my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending . 
the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before . 
the ending itself was just plain strange . 
the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch . 
while the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening . 
"
pos	" "" seven "" is one of the best mystery movies i've ever seen . 
it's extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it's also quite fun . 
it's a serial killer mystery , but you don't care so much about making the killer pay as much as hope they just catch the killer . 
the story is a cops-on-the-trail-of-serial-killer mystery . 
someone is murdering people who are offenders of "" the seven deadly sins . "" 
a fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions . . . 
i could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much . 
what makes this film so unique is the characterization of the "" good guys "" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile . 
brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie . 
however , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he doesn't get killed by the end ) . 
there is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief . 
this is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down-played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment . 
the setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be . 
the production design is superb , in the spirit of "" batman "" and "" the crow , "" this film embodies the gothic mood . 
the way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary ! 
the killer's victims have no connections at all , and thus mills and sommerset don't have much to go on to solve the case . 
they can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense . 
we become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown . 
not that many films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this . 
the only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect . 
let's just say it seems a little too "" mystery movie , "" or too convenient in other words . 
when they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe , a terrific chase scene ensues . 
this is a typical thrilling element , but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story . 
if anything , this film is the epitome of twist endings . 
i don't have to tell you mills and sommerset finally catch the criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising . 
there is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he's obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points . 
what's even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is . 
 "" seven "" is not just a film about crime , but about the evil within man . 
john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of "" scum . "" 
but as justified as he makes himself seem , we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice .

pos	"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . 
either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . 
why is this ? 
maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . 
director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . 
when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . 
i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . 
i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . 
and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . 
rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . 
he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . 
and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . 
he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . 
whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . 
grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . 
rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . 
during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . 
but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . 
the plot in three words is : women and music . 
the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . 
it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . 
it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . 
jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . 
just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . 
what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . 
john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . 
now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . 
the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . 
instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . 
also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . 
high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . 
i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great .

pos	"tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end . 
all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie . 
if you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie . 
it's hilarious . 
how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ? 
easy . 
write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick . 
will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day . 
at night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to . 
the only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss . 
the script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury . 
their flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury . 
grieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris . 
what follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever . 
the music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez's born to be alive . 
the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin' alive . 
it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump . 
one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will 
and chris don't have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away . 
an art-imitates-life poke at shallow women . 
it's a scene that's an approximate parody of the vinegar's own rolf luedeke's editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now . 
ted "" unabomber "" 
kaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie . 
of course , the script wouldn't be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) . 
nevertheless , will's father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile . 
during the wedding ceremony , will's heart isn't exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris . 
definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony . 
i found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi's head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared . 
the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone . 
more art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world . 
the idiots' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks 
don't play well anymore ( she's a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down . 
i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in 
need of a lot of laughs . 
go with a date . 
brandi laughed non-stop , as i 
did , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes .

pos	"plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . 
he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . 
oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? 
kewl ! 
critique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . 
although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . 
i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! 
i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . 
i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . 
plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . 
i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . 
i also hated the "" kid "" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you 
coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . 
but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . 
this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either . 
now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . 
visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . 
the "" surprise ending "" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . 
so overall , i loved the whole "" feel "" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . 
but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . 
ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( "" this is a mad house ! "" - 
type of thing ) . 
the guy in this film barely seems to be "" put off "" by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !

pos	"did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ? 
that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow . 
she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder . 
the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win . 
jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history . 
he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber . 
his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 . 
the background to the case is such . 
during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke . 
the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will . 
when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood . 
claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail . 
he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him . 
ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him . 
we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out . 
dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case . 
nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him . 
together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed . 
silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film . 
schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz . 
there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical . 
yet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well . 
the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks . 
the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending . 
the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion . 
the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters . 
yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons . 
as von bulow , he is brutally evil . 
anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame . 
irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence . 
he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder . 
however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility . 
there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness . 
however , legally , did he do the murder ? 
schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind . 
with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind . 
schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death . 
for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully . 
we don't know what happened . 
that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works . 
in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever . 
irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .

rated r . 
filmmakers jump on real-life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell . 
the debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up , and already someone's made a movie about it , and it's not , thank god , a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy . 
instead we get a sharp , biting satire that takes no prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed . 
based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights . 
the movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r-rated movie and learn some naughty words . 
when they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to "" blame canada , "" wage war against the neighbor country and execute "" terrence and phillip , "" the flatulent actors in the obscene film . 
the kids form an alliance they name "" la resistance "" ( with the accent on the third syllable of "" resistance "" ) to save their favorite thespians , in a hilarious spoof of ( tribute to ? ) 
les mis ? rables . 
in a subplot , one of the characters ( kenny , who else ? ) 
dies and goes to hell where he meets satan . 
satan and saddam hussein are lovers , you see . 
satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex . 
apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth . 
aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all-stops-out musical , with unforgettable numbers like "" shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er "" and "" cartman's mom is a big fat bitch "" . 
almost invariably it's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny . 
the same can be said for the rest of the movie : it's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner ( i . e . 
toilet humor , endless profanity , etc . ) . 
not that there's anything wrong with that : vulgarity , when done right , is my bag , baby . 
trey parker and matt stone , the twenty-somethings behind the film and the show , paint a bulls-eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it . 
cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities aren't uttered , the auteurs throw some nasty one-liner insults their way . 
the ratings-a-plenty association isn't the only target of this unsparing banter : people who favor censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game , with the "" blame canada "" plot being a not-so-cheap shot at them . 
the distinctively low-tech "" cardboard "" animation is oddly effective , even more so than the state of the art "" deep canvas "" technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan . 
it's more pleasant to look at , less intimidating up on the screen , and most importantly it doesn't detract from the film's concept as much as disney's admirably awe-inspiring work does . 
the show's popularity has been waning as of late , and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings . 
perhaps not . 
having seen the show on numerous occasions , i can say that it's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie . 
the series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years . 
parker and stone have outdone themselves to the point where i am forced to ask : must the show go on ?

pos	"everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with "" progress . "" 
giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . 
his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth . 
this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns "" erstwhile fogy "" giles into a three-dimensional human being . 
despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love . 
and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places . 
giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . 
what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . 
a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . 
just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight . 
giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . 
 ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . ) 
eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located . 
bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . 
eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice . 
but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant . 
love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . 
in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect . 
it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . 
in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target . 
in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited . 
from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame . 
it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions . 
jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . 
he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie . 
meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin . 
love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a "" fish out of water "" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . 
yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . 
it has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .

pos	"at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie . 
on second glance it looks that way too . 
although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad . 
admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ) . 
but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the "" haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? "" 
feeling that creeps up all too often during the film . 
sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team . 
by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film . 
 "" what disaster is that ? "" 
you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat . 
glad you asked . 
through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city . 
the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel . 
good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it . 
sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside . 
so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak . 
the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie . 
not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again ) . 
daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star . 
amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper . 
oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too . 
sage -- nice name . 
i guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley . 
note to sage -- you are still young . 
go to school and get a good education -- you don't have a future in acting . 
the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable . 
mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks . 
the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie . 
as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one . 
i realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable . 
adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn't know what he is doing . 
why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ? 
would this be too much to ask ? 
can't we all just get along ? 
special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better . 
some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim . 
especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) . 
i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn't sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure . 
i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use . 
the underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well . 
they were the best part of the movie by a long shot . 
better than average stallone flick . 
i realize that's not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume . 
but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger . 
daylight is a fun movie , and as long as you aren't expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised .

pos	"the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer's "" odyssey "" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in "" o brother , where art thou ? "" 
right for the beginning of "" o brother "" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song . 
the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field . 
it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio . 
a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films . 
their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in "" raising arizona "" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in "" miller's crossing "" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in "" fargo . "" 
in all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people . 
ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department . 
but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1 . 2 million . 
their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . 
there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . 
the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . 
some of the interludes are an epiphany , though . 
the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . 
they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow . "" 
it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year . 
contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of "" o brother . "" 
in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched . 
the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "" the wizard of oz . "" 
they don't say "" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! "" 
and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here . 
the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels . 
george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today . 
he has the charm of a 30's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity . 
ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets . 
his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer . 
while clooney is the name draw for "" o brother , "" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar .

pos	"some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . 
that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . 
such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . 
something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . 
one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . 
van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home . 
however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . 
infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . 
unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . 
things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . 
almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . 
it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . 
in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . 
for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . 
on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . 
but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . 
the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called "" sexual revolution "" , same as all other "" revolutions "" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . 
instead of being "" liberated "" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . 
schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . 
the difference between the two is simply in the line of work . 
many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . 
on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . 
in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare . 
the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . 
van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . 
on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . 
even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . 
unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . 
the script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . 
apart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . 
but the content might be more than interesting for today's viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . 
until boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . 
hardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . 
the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn't be too surprising . 
anyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema .

pos	"wow ! what a movie . 
it's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . 
yep that pretty much describes this movie . 
it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . 
it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often . 
besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . 
period . 
then again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite . 
john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . 
his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . 
craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you 
have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . 
he is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . 
in his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . 
to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind . 
fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . 
he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind . 
lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . 
john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened . 
john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . 
he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . 
cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . 
she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . 
catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . 
the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . 
spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . 
he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . 
by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . 
the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking . 
the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming . 
the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . 
from cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . 
there isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea . 
there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time . 
i found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . 
by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore . 
or why they don't . 
all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . 
this was a surprise hit as was american beauty . 
'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . 
it has something that no other movies playing now has . 
in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . 
i highly recommend 'being john malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed . 
"
pos	"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . 
although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . 
so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . 
although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . 
quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . 
the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . 
not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . 
kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . 
it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . "" 
maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . 
it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . 
soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . 
at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . 
walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . 
fine performances are turned in all around . 
maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . 
walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . 
daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . 
for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . 
also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . 
there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't . 
"
pos	"call it touched by a demon . 
gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . 
if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . 
in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . 
 ( remember bob ? ) 
the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . 
a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . 
now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around . "" 
shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk . 
minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . 
but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . 
and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . 
only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against . 
the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . 
as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . 
no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . 
the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks . 
shadows and night scenes abound . 
the days are cloudy and unpromising . 
this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . 
fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . 
somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . 
but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . 
nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . 
the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . 
of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . 
john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . 
sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . 
everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring . 
washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . 
it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting . 
there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . 
as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . 
washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . 
however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . 
to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . 
that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . 
both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . 
narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . 
although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . 
at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow . 
in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . 
however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . 
the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . 
it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . 
at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . 
this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . 
and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .

pos	" ( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course ) 
we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world . 
and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) . 
no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat . 
about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' . 
the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . 
she can't go higher than him . 
he won't allow it . 
and what's amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . 
early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . 
it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist . 
and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around "" nice "" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters . 
it's with mandy barnett's "" if you'll be the teacher "" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony . 
sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success . 
it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries . 
satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not . 
it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( "" drop dead gorgeous "" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) . 
payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart . 
we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about . 
minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen "" ferris bueller's day off "" . 
whatever .

pos	"the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen . 
in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven . 
his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of . 
that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage . 
the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . . 
with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator . 
luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie . 
talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career . 
his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona . 
he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey . 
he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however . 
ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show . 
quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer . 
unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all ! 
also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia . 
she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her . 
the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy . 
the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film . 
peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun . 
the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card . 
although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll . 
sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam . 
also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing . 
the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim . 
while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do . 
also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show . 
overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment . 
certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone . 
it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed .

 "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes

pos	"back in 1998 dreamworks unveiled their first computer animated movie "" antz "" . 
the film was critically acclaimed , and went on to gross almost $100m dollars at the domestic box office . 
again in 1998 they released their traditional animated film "" the prince of egypt "" and it named an instant classic , and became a huge hit as well . 
on a winning streak , they released "" the road to el dorado "" and it wasn't as big as they hoped , but still did ok , then they had the fantastic "" chicken run "" in the summer . 
now in 2001 dreamworks has released what i can safely name , one of the top five best animated films . 
shrek ( mike myers ) is about a loving , green ogre who lives in the woods of duloc by himself . 
surrounded by fairy tale characters , he hopes somehow he would escape from everyone . 
the ruler of duloc is the short , heartless lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) , who is offering a reward to all the fairy tale creatures , if they are captured and arrested . 
of course many of the owners turn them in for gold and silver , but one of those creatures is donkey ( eddie murphy ) . 
a regular donkey , except he talks and has a definite attitude , after his owner tries to disown him , he escapes into the woods , and runs into shrek . 
lord farquaad however , has different plans and makes all the fairy tale creatures in the woods near shrek's house . 
to get his property back , and his life back shrek must rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) so lord farquaad can be a king . 
shrek wants his property back , but he never thought he would fall in love with princess fiona . 
 "" shrek "" is such an amazing film , that while watching it you can't help but just smile the entire time and wonder why that other production company can't make movies like this . 
the animated graphics are so great , that they look every bit of realistic . 
i saw previews for this film all last year , and i thought to myself wow , what a great movie this will be . 
i must say i was not disappointed at all , and the film is the best of 2001 so far , and will go down on my best of 2001 list at the end of the year . 
the voice talents are brilliant as well , with the comic genius mike myers . 
in the past he has been a wayne , an austin , and a person married to an ax murderer . 
now he is shrek , not only does he do the voice talent . . . but he is shrek . 
with his irish accent , and he lovable personality , shrek becomes a friend to the audience and warms your heart . 
eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s "" mulan "" does another bang up job here , and he is the comic relief in the film . 
the tones of his voice , the lines he utters , and the jokes he gives , he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in "" aladdin "" . 
the always beautiful cameron diaz gives the voice of princess fiona and she does a great job as well . 
she is very funny , and her character fits her to a t . of course the best supporting voice is john lithgow , who is personally one of my favorite actors . 
he as the bad guy lord farquaad does a great job in being both sinister and funny at the same time . 
at times i was so amazed by the computer graphics , that you can't help but just start looking at backgrounds . 
there is many hidden jokes in the film , and even reflections of light on the screen like a camera . 
 "" shrek "" is a definite kid film , but not just a kid film for it is a film for the entire family to enjoy . 
there are many adult jokes in the film that the kids won't get , but the parents will be laughing . 
believe me though , everyone will be laughing the entire way through . 
in the end , "" shrek "" gives a very important message to it's audience to enjoy and be who you are . 
everybody out there is beautiful in their own way , even though it may be inside . 
there's not many words that can praise "" shrek "" enough , but my words to you is to stop what you are doing and see this movie now .

pos	"the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself . 
but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things . 
not that it's bad , it's just that it's been done before ; and better , in my opinion . 
i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ? 
that's basically how i felt about this movie . 
i mean , it's not very good , but it's not completely bad either . 
the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) . 
she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you 
know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn't give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) . 
thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) . 
near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods . 
once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i'm still not quite sure what line of work he's in ) . 
making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars . 
one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) . 
they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal . 
after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to "" take care "" of the problem . 
managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband . 
but then one night , cole shows up . . . 
and here is where the fun begins . 
from this point on , it's going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects . 
this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out . 
and for the most part , they're right ; the rich man's wife has nary one original bone in it's body . 
but who cares ? 
if you're looking for good ol' dumb suspense movie , you can't do much better than this .

pos	"bruce willis is a type-casted actor . 
in die hard , he played john mcclaine , a rough and tough chicago cop who gets caught in the wrong place at the wrong time . 
again , in pulp fiction , as butch coolidge , an over-the-hill boxer , he steps on the wrong guys toes . 
in luc besson's the fifth element , willis plays korben dallas , a new york cabby who takes in the wrong passenger at the worst possible time . 
a stylish science fiction epic , the fifth element's complex plot begins right away , in the deserts of egypt ( think stargate ) in 1914 . 
an enormous spacecraft lands above a pyramid where the "" 5 elements "" are stored and takes them away , vowing to return them when the evil comes back . 
cut to present day , which is our future . 
the year is 2023 , and new york is the city . 
the only basic differences between besson's futuristic depiction and the real life new york is that the smog is thicker , the buildings are higher , and the traffic floats ! 
anyway , the "" evil "" comes back as a ball of fire to wreak havoc on the fair citizens of the earth , so back come the tortoise-like aliens to return the "" 5 elements "" to earth , in order to defend themselves against the "" evil . "" 
in the process , however , the ship is intercepted by 2 fighter pods and is destroyed before landing . 
when officials arrive at the site , all that remains is a hand . 
what can you do with a hand ? 
hey , its the 21st century here-dna reconstruction ! 
this hand turns out to belong to a beautiful , but mysterious woman named leeloo ( milla jovovich , dazed and confused ) . 
she escapes and , attempting to escape the police by swan diving off of an enormous skyscraper and crashing through the roof of korben's floating cab . 
it's love at first site , as korben and leeloo elude the lazy-as-always cops . 
when leeloo begins mumbling about a cornelius ( ian holm , night falls on manhattan ) , korben searches the "" yellow pages "" and delivers her to the door of the good reverend , the only man who knows of her background and duties . 
now , korben , leeloo , and cornelius must journey to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship ( special effects were spectacular here ) to find the remaining four elements . 
it is here , where they discover that they have been followed by the evil jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg ( gary oldman , murder in the first ) . 
he , too , wants possession of the elements , as do a group of pig-like warriors ( think the gamorreans in return of the jedi ) . 
in a spectacular ending , with time running out , leeloo is faced with a problem-why should she save a people who live to destroy each other ? 
the question is a good one , and one that could be pondered . 
but enough of that . 
when korben points out his love for her , leeloo is inclined to become the "" 5th element "" and save the world from total destruction . 
the fifth element features good performances by willis and holm , an excellent portrayal of a comedic villain ( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson's the joker in batman ) by one of the masters of villainy , oldman , and a heartfelt offering by relative newcomer jovovich . 
the supporting cast , which includes brion james ( tango & cash ) , tim "" tiny "" lester ( no holds barred ) , luke perry ( buffy the vampire slayer ) , and chris tucker ( friday ) , added a comedic effect to the film . 
although besson's the fifth element can be criticized for the outlandish use of cliches , it is a solid motion picture with a definite point . 
some other directors ( like anaconda's luis llosa ) should take a lesson from this guy-using ideas from epic motion pictures the right way . 
ideas from star wars and stargate were utilized for the improvement of this film . 
sci-fi fan or not , any movie-lover should see this wonderfully stylish motion picture .

pos	"the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made . 
a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget . 
in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives . 
the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together . 
michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group . 
after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works . 
three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married . 
after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times . 
this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war . 
the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act . 
the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future . 
the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong . 
the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river . 
this prison , run by the v . c . , 
initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other . 
steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate . 
michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun . 
personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes . 
the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated . 
michael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital . 
michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero . 
he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him . 
he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam . 
the third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette . 
only in this game , you play for money . 
michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him . 
the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home . 
a very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed . 
the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling . 
do not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you .

pos	"i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years . 
it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood . 
but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex . 
yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster . 
for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage . 
and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking . 
and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer . 
`american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year . 
just how great are their hormones raging ? 
one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot . 
the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim . 
kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right . 
but what is the perfect time ? 
there is just no way to know , and that frightens him . 
oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive . 
he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages . 
finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl . 
so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess . 
suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him . 
but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful . 
when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through . 
he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge . 
this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny . 
the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating . 
there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald . 
in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating . 
but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison . 
teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest . 
but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here . 
these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex . 
their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences . 
they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility . 
but almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch .

pos	"the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . 
thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . 
through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . 
life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . 
living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . 
although dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . 
unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . 
it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest . 
although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness . 
now , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . 
benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . 
the supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . 
life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . 
in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a "" saturday night live "" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious . 
characters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome . 
in all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first "" artsy "" film . 
life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture .

pos	"whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . 
he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs . miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 ) . 
the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . 
by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . 
there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom . 
instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity . 
the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes . 
he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . 
rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . 
a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it . 
whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been "" screwing around . "" 
after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . 
he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . 
rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . 
it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that . 
as another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six-pack . "" 
rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . 
he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . 
dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . 
from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . 
altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . 
if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining . 
gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . 
a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . 
in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . 
altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . 
but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . 
 "" the gingerbread man "" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . 
however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . 
a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . 
here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . 
rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . 
without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration . 
the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in "" schindler's list "" ( 1993 ) . 
tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . 
it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . 
while "" the gingerbread man "" isn't in league with altman's greatest works like "" nashville "" ( 1975 ) or "" the player "" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . 
some critics love to stamp films like this as "" commercial , "" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money . 
altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .

pos	"i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . 
the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . 
i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . 
maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . 
maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . 
but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . 
the story of serendipity is simple . 
two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . 
charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . 
but with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . 
sara declares that if this "" thing "" -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . 
years later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . 
what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that "" thing "" was right after all . 
fortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . 
coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . 
both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters 
on the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand . 
but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture .

pos	"synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro . 
the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . 
comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . 
even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . 
star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew . 
star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good . "" 
after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . 
i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . 
most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . 
let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . 
okay . let's move to the movie itself . 
star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . 
this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . 
much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew . 
audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . 
star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld . 
forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . 
this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a . 
it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . 
the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties . 
sound pretty heavy ? 
it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor . 
when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . 
in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . 
the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . 
since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . 
the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb . 
brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . 
the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . 
despite many other critics' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough . 
ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . 
like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . 
in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . 
ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . 
 ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) 
donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . 
murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . 
this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . 
in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . 
a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . 
for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing . 
they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . 
the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . 
the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . 
despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . 
it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . 
i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . 
rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .

pos	"this is the movie not the perfume . 
a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo . 
it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader . 
set in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy . 
his real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes . 
upon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed . 
inspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers . 
but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found . 
grieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop . 
sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife . 
when he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife . 
her name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she's working there restoring art that is decaying . 
he falls instantly in love with her and doesn't heed bob's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her . 
sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him . 
the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow . 
it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way .

pos	"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . 
lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . 
the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . 
most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . 
it takes a pretty smart person to do that . 
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? 
what if he's also able to think on his feet ? 
in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? 
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . 
in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . 
when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . 
faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . 
i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" , 
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did . 
luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . 
after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . 
walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . 
although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . 
jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . 
the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . 
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . 
how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? 
unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . 
almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . 
when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . 
his is an interesting character . 
made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . 
 "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says . 
when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . 
soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . 
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . 
as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . 
gray really lucked out with this cast . 
david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . 
the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . 
in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . 
with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . 
also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . 
his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . 
fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . 
j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . 
sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . 
walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . 
for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . 
when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . 
the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . 
in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . 
we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . 
as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . 
both provide some pretty good entertainment .

pos	"while alex browning ( devon sawa ) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris , bad omens seem to surround him . 
as soon as he buckles into the plane , he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take-off . 
when the vision begins to come true , alex bolts for the door , dragging several students and a teacher in his wake . 
the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted . 
he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community , and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die . 
alex and another survivor , clear rivers ( ali larter ) , investigate the suspicious "" suicide "" of a friend , and a mortician ( tony "" candyman "" todd ) clues them in to the truth : alex interrupted death's design by saving people who should have died in the explosion , and death will want to claim its rightful victims . 
in order to save himself and the others , alex will have to figure out death's new plan and thwart it . 
of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the "" scream "" audience , "" final destination "" is the best so far . 
talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula . 
we've seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one-by-one by a faceless slasher , but reddick cuts out the hockey-masked middle-man and makes the villain death itself . 
first-time feature director james wong made the most of that premise . 
every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding , reminding us that death is everywhere , can come at anytime . 
everyday objects and events vibrate with menace . 
the most amusing harbinger of doom : john denver's "" rocky mountain high , "" which is played several times in the movie before someone dies . 
 ( the link is that denver died in a plane crash , and the song includes a line about fire in the sky . ) 
the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror . 
devon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , "" idle hands , "" gives a frantic and convincing lead performance . 
kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane . 
smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence . 
seann william scott , who's also in theaters right now in "" road trip , "" plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter . 
tony todd's one-scene cameo is delicious but all too brief . 
bottom line : watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between , but this destination is worth visiting .

pos	"hollywood has a . 750 
batting average with elmore leonard adaptations . 
last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies . 
steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love . 
george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . 
he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . 
nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . 
clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . 
clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun . 
in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm . 
of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good . 
it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit . 
clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans . 
meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez . 
unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes . 
rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney . 
he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . 
the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . 
the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . 
although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . 
out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . 
this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . 
the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites . 
here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch . 
serving america for almost 1/20th of a century !

steve spielberg goes beyond reality with his latest production . 
the audience is tossed about the theatre witnessing the horror of war . 
please keep the kids home as the r rating is for reality . 
tom hanks is stunning as capt john miller , set out in france during ww ii to rescue and return home a soldier , private ryan ( matt damon ) who lost three brothers in the war . 
spielberg at time takes us inside the heads of these individuals as they face death during the horrific battle scenes . 
private ryan is not for everyone , but i felt the time was right for a movie like this to be made . 
the movie reminds us of the sacrifices made by our ww ii fighting men and women . 
we must not ever forget them as many gave the ultimate sacrifice , their lives so that we may live in freedom today . 
for this i thank them and for steve spielberg for making a movie that i will never forget . 
the academy will not forget tom hanks come april 1999 , as another well deserved oscar with be in tom's posession .

pos	"i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture . 
i still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies . 
and i think that "" 12 angry men "" , "" witness for the prosecution "" and "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . 
but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents . 
the film is set in burma in 1943 . 
a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . 
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen . 
struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . 
afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . 
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . 
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . 
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . 
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . 
and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" . 
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . 
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . 
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . 
the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . 
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . 
 ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) 
that means , the picture isn't perfect . 
but it has a lot of virtues as well . 
 "" the bridge on the river kwai "" shows the "" madness "" of war and what it can produce in people's minds . 
it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . 
and lean's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . 
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . 
david lean's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . 
his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . 
the film is also well-photographed and has an apt score . 
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . 
the other actors deliver fine performances as well . 
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

pos	"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . 
after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . 
john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars . 
bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . 
jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . 
most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . 
that is , until now . 
jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . 
after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . 
jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . 
despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . 
pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . 
more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . 
describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else . 
i will tread lightly . 
jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . 
the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . 
we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . 
for a hefty price . 
ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . 
however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . 
they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . 
they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing . 
but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . 
ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . 
after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . 
ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . 
this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . 
revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . 
tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . 
his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . 
they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . 
of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . 
and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . 
of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it . 
things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . 
this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . 
on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . 
however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original . 
the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive . 
the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand . 
his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the "" leaps "" in time . 
perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard . 
the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . 
the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . 
and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . 
the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . 
the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters' actions . 
nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on . 
the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . 
her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . 
watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking . 
her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . 
bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . 
i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) . 
michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . 
chris tucker has a small , but effective performance . 
samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . 
but no matter . . . 
jackson is very strong in his role . 
robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends . 
robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . 
he is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . 
jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . 
as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . 
however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino's pulp fiction , and expect great results . 
when compared , it comes up short , but not that short . 
it's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . 
perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . 
i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . 
expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) .

pos	"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to . 
it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy . 
yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story . 
the wings of the dove fits the pattern . 
kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love . 
merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate . 
but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class . 
her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man . 
naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich . "" 
kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable . 
kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice . 
at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees . 
kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her . 
it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup . 
merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it . 
he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute . 
the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated . 
let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton . 
merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate . 
kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple . 
a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact . 
at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies . 
millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate . 
she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees . 
kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together . 
merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her . 
he's not sure he can separate the two . 
kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else . 
the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved . 
without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly . 
the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament . 
one is left with feelings of regret and despair . 
what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy . 
an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir . 
a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after . 
their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake . 
i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting . 
as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot . 
roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie . 
millie's part didn't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible . 
i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion . 
their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially . 
still , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over . 
"
pos	"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . 
i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . 
as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . 
it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . 
norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . 
he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . 
the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . 
we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . 
in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . 
much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . 
when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . 
what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . 
it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . 
because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . 
i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . 
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . 
it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . 
of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . 
it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . 
in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . 
even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . 
what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . 
the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . 
visually , the film is very powerful . 
kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . 
but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . 
although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . 
for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . 
it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . 
perhaps this last scene was the problem . 
it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .

10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew . 
that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . 
with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance . 
yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . 
the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford . 
their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . 
in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family "" no dating "" policy is amended to "" bianca can date . . . when 
[katarina] does . "" 
with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew . 
don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister "" . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . "" 
getting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing . 
when cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice . 
the scheme they dream up is to fully exploit "" someone with money . "" 
in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . 
cameron's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . 
the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . 
this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . 
moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that "" hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . "" 
the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . 
providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend's betrayal , and prom . 
it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she's all that , and can't hardly wait . 
yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way . 
"
pos	"in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . 
full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . 
go see it ! 
so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's . 
 "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . 
smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . 
 ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) 
smart's got a point . 
it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . 
however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . 
real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . 
to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . 
the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . ' 
of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . 
but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . 
kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . 
i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . 
her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . 
kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . 
she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . 
at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . 
 "" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "" 
her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . 
this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . 
the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . 
he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors . 
kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . 
phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . 
his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever . 
phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . 
gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . 
he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . 
van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . 
van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . 
the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers . 
henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . 
henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . 
danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . 
either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . 
all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! 
to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant . 
written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .

pos	"well i'll be damned . . . 
the canadians can make a good movie . 
the world is coming to an end . 
we don't know why or how , but apparently there is no way to stop it . 
the world has had this information for months , as most of the rioting and other assorted chaos has passed and governments have shut down operations . 
yet for a handful of toronto citizens , life goes on . 
they aren't going crazy or attacking people in the streets . 
instead they are simply preparing themselves for the end . . . 
some engaging in activities they've always wanted to do , some gathering with family and friends , and others just seeking to be alone . 
these people's lives however all intersect during their final six hours . 
writer-director-star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique and emotional film . 
all of the main characters are compelling as they try and do whatever it is they need to do on their last night on earth . 
craig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but isn't having much success . 
even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer . 
things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it's not a happy film . . . 
some moments are understandably gut-wrenching ) . 
the story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances , particularly from sandra oh , whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end . 
i have absolutely no problem that the reason for the end of the world is never given , nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway ) . 
but i do wonder why the sun never sets . 
come midnight , the sun is still shining brightly . 
maybe the sun is crashing into the earth . . . 
who knows . 
also , it's comforting to know that in mankind's final moments on the planet , people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus ( that's not a shot at this film mind you . . . 
i know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars ) . 
last night is available on dvd from universal home video . 
it contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer .

pos	"hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) . 
they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment . 
the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this . 
originally rated nc-17 for language . 
not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears . 
killing zoe =========== 
remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery . 
eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers . 
he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go . 
though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino . 
in english and french . 
the road to wellville ===================== 
based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far . 
bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation . 
he also invented the cornflake . 
really . 
checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy . 
leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey . 
the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama . 
what he ends up with is something that i can't print here . 
phew ! 
stargate ======== 
lawrence of arabia meets star wars . 
this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else . 
director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on . 
the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history . 
that said , there's still plenty to watch here . 
sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader . 
he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that "" somebody else "" built the pyramids . 
less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame . 
star trek generations ===================== 
trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best . 
the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long . 
the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch . 
and so on . 
 ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ) 
original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead "" get a life . "" 
remarkably unremarkable . 
miracle on 34th street ====================== 
in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary . 
john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original . 
the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle . 
his chemistry with children can moisten any eye . 
no claus for alarm . 
junior ====== 
arnold schwarzenegger pregnant ? 
sure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie . 
what should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along . 
director ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect . 
don't expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can't beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie . 
how's * that * for a collision of acting styles ? 
"
pos	"it's hard not to recommend "" the others . "" 
the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( "" open your eyes "" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace . 
the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances . 
but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied . 
overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy . 
watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , "" get on with it ! "" 
as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "" the others , "" my reaction was much the same . 
set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman . 
anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time . 
at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family . 
the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not . 
to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts . 
grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them . 
that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear . 
earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog . 
the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding . 
i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural . 
grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper . 
when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do . 
but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending . 
 "" the others "" sets out to be a classic ghost story , but fails to grasp that special something that makes such films more than layers of mist .

rated : r ( ! ) for sexual content , crude and sexual humor , and some nudity . . 
 ( a mild r rating ) 
starring : rob schneider , oded fehr , eddie griffin , arija bareikis , amy poehler , norm mcdonald . 
running time : 88 minutes 
 "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is simply a hilarious good-natured comedy that may offend some , but underneath all it's crude humor and sexual content is a sweet little love story that is surprisingly involving . 
it isn't any kind of cinematic classic , but it's a very very funny comedy that keeps us entertained until the end credits which themselves are funny too . 
it has all it needs to be a breezy entertaining comedy : the acting is up to pace and some of the performances quite funny , the screenplay is witty and smart , and the whole story is sweet and cute . 
deuce bigalow ( rob schneider ) is your typically average guy : he cleans fish tanks for a living and gets an average of 10 bucks for it . 
though one might call him a loser , deuce gets a job he would never thought he would get . 
he gets to clean the tank for a male gigolo ( oded fehr ) and gets offered to watch over his place while he goes on a trip . 
trying to be like him he hangs upside down from a pole and accidentally pushes off the fishtank and burns his cabinets . 
the thing is now he has to try and find $6 , 000 dollars in three weeks to make sure everything looks right again . 
so he decides to go "" man-whoring "" and to his luck gets the oddest people on earth : an over-weight woman who decidedly wants to eat everything in site , a woman with narcolepsy who sleeps all the time , a woman who has sudden screaming outbursts , and a woman he can't stop thinking about . 
he charges $10 but he is willing to negotiate . 
from now on he is considered deuce bigalow : male gigolo . 
with non-stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is sometimes like last years hit "" there's something about mary "" that is offensive but very funny . 
the screenplay by harris goldberg and rob schneider himself is a smart , clever and witty screenplay that seems to have been written with care to make is so hilariously funny . 
the characters in the film are all actually likable especially "" jabba lady "" with her big body but soft heart . 
there are actually times in the movie where i fell out of my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me . 
even though i thought "" toy story 2 "" and "" being john malkovich "" were the funniest of the year "" deuce bigalow "" follows right behind them . 
the directing by mike mitchell is fantastic and shows he took time on the film . 
rob schneider gives a surprisingly endearing performance and when his romance develops with one of his customers kate ( arija bareikis ) it is a sweet romance that we get involved in and actually like being involved in it . 
 "" deuce bigalow "" is a good-natured film worth all the merit it can get . 
its not a classic or a masterpiece , it's just a comedy that we don't feel bad about watching . 
sure it may come off as offensive and may come off as dumb sometimes , but you cannot deny that it isn't funny . 
 "" deuce bigalow : male gigolo "" is no disappointment . 
its a fast paced , entertaining sweet and hilarious comedy that may be destined to become a cult classic . 
fans of schneider will not be disappointed and fans of crude but nice comedies will not either . 
for some reason the film garnered an r rating but with no "" f words "" or extensive use of sexual content or explicit nudity i was really wondering why the film was r . a mild r to put it to the least , but even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film is good enough for you to see . 
don't try to be one of those people who make so much of a film that they do not like it , just sit back , laugh and enjoy the movie .

pos	"it's not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts . 
but that's just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic's big screen debut . 
uhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid . 
but it's dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it's so silly and outrageous it's hilarious . 
the movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he's indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns . 
george is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks . 
but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station . 
george revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like "" wheel of fish "" and movies like "" conan , the librarian . "" 
as the station's ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate . 
as r . j . 
fletcher--channel 8's ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls . 
uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children's shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters . 
the funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed . 
like most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss . 
for every gag that works , at least one fizzles . 
for instance , weird al's mock video of "" money for nothing "" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) . 
but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way . 
in fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since . . . 
well , since airplane . 
much of the credit goes to weird al's exceptionally inventive script and to the movie's winsome cast . 
weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning , but because he's not afraid to look silly , he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character . 
the real standout is michael richards as stanley , the dim-witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children's show : "" stanley spadowski's playhouse . "" 
stanley's off-beat , mixed-up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over-night star . 
he is an endearing mixture of good-natured innocence , high-energy enthusiasm , and puppy-dog cuteness . 
and above all , he's a good janitor who adores his work . 
another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips . 
the cast also features gedde watanabe ( the chinese foreign-exchange student in sixteen candles ) as the karate master who hosts the hit series , "" wheel of fish . "" 
also aboard for the ride is fran drescher , who plays pamela finklestein , channel 62's roving reporter . 
unfortunately , as weird al's girlfriend , victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering , whining , and sulking . 
her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether . 
while uhf is not an absolute must-see , it's definitely the ticket if you're looking for a wild and zany , whacked-out comedy . 
the movie is good enough to see in the theaters , but it may work even better on television , the very medium at which it pokes fun .

pos	"what is a scary movie anyhow ? 
is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? 
is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? 
possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . 
what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters . 
movies like "" halloween "" and "" psycho "" which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled "" the exorcist "" , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 "" the exorcist "" comes back to the big screen in a version you've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending . 
chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan . 
while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden . 
when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter . 
father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl . 
christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl . 
excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death . 
now we get to the experience "" the exorcist "" the way it was meant to be seen in a director's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more . 
the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing . 
the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness . 
as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is "" the exorcist "" nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on . 
ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in "" requiem for a dream "" to which she is getting rave reviews for . 
jason miller ( jason patrik's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along . 
i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff ! 
anyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going . 
hopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .

pos	"when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space . 
it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . 
but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet . 
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks . 
if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? 
-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex . 
even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery . 
the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody . 
all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america . 
ironically , powers' "" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! "" 
has almost become an icon of the late 90s . 
thus another installment was inevitable , but it's also undoubtedly welcome . 
the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life . 
it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones . 
austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you'll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen . 
he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again . 
surprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin . 
he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie . 
perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately . 
instead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe . 
the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting more . 
by the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites . 
even by its conclusions , i'm still not sure i've had my fill of bits like "" do you smoke after sex ? "" 
 "" i don't know , baby , i never looked . "" 
this may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny . 
i don't know if i've ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious "" just the two of us "" rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named "" mini-me "" . 
i don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort . 
indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did . 
but as far as i'm concerned , that is enough .

pos	"i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . 
i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . 
i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . 
the basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . 
he's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . 
he's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce . 
his loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . 
during the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . 
after a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . 
on the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . 
first of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . 
the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . 
there is some character development during the film . 
the actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . 
the movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . 
the movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . 
humor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . 
there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . 
however , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . 
the film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt . 
this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . 
there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert . 
some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . 
since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . 
overall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . 
it may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain .

pos	"capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . 
the first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . 
a young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . 
then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen . 
this is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . 
 ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) 
the plot is simple but not simpleminded . 
sweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . 
along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . 
in other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . 
ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( "" by an all-white jury "" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it's hardly surprising why . 
there's a good deal of sex in the movie , but it's handled in a way that's unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . 
in one scene , sweetback visits a friend's house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . 
we're not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . 
the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles' hands . 
one scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . 
another note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one's own mind . 
ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows .

pos	"the happy bastard's 30-second review 
big daddy 
happy gilmore as a father ? 
of course ! 
that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work . 
he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him . 
he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) . 
his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . 
enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip . 
from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . 
he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . 
the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle . 
i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all . 
fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good . 
sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies . 
rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read . 
stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch . 
look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum . 
he's a hoot . 
directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with . 
again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes .

pos	"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies . 
from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy . 
but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves . 
shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . 
sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a . 
pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience . 
no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul . 
the excitement starts before the music even begins . 
a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so . 
there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick . 
and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! "" 
you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street . 
this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience . 
it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain . 
and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love . 
even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats . 
the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal . 
all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time . 
in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time . 
for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating . 
all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us . 
the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in . 
if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled . 
it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore . 
instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .

pos	"while screen adaptations of john irving's novels have been disappointingly uneven , the films have all shared one particular strength : key casting . 
who can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon , the transsexual quarterback of "" the world according to garp , "" or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in "" the hotel new hampshire "" ? 
a lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of "" the cider house rules , "" an adaptation of irving's poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man called homer wells . 
among those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid tobey maguire assume the pivotal role ; the decision to cast michael caine as his mentor and father figure , dr . wilbur larch , the ether-addicted head obstetrician of the st . cloud's orphanage , maine ; and the decision to offer jane alexander and kathy baker supporting roles as his head nurses . 
then there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where homer wells finds himself shortly after leaving st . cloud's , including delroy lindo , oscar ? -worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them . 
there's kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house , and charlize theron as candy , the lovely , lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot ( paul rudd ) sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells , a man who's never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster . 
am i forgetting anyone ? 
yes . 
kieran culkin and paz de la huerta as dissolute orphanage residents who make you sit up and take notice every time they're on the screen . 
but with "" the cider house rules , "" the good people decisions don't end with the cast . 
irving has written his own screenplay in order to get it right this time ( last year's "" simon birch , "" loosely based on his "" a prayer for owen meaney , "" was a big-screen example of irving handled sub-standardly ) ; the author appears fleetingly as a stationmaster here . 
rachel portman , a composer of such sweet and lyrical tenderness , provides a score that's absolutely right for the project--sweet , lyrical , and tender . 
there's impressive new england photography by oliver stapleton too . 
last but by no means least is "" my life as a dog "" director lasse hallstr ? m , who shows enormous skill in pulling this collective together and helping bring irving's marvelously touching story to life . 
for the many beloved who pass away in "" the cider house rules , "" it's an extraordinarily life-affirming story . 
and now , thanks to these talented individuals , it's an extraordinarily life-affirming film .

pos	"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . 
the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . 
everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . 
although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . 
liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . 
the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . 
there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . 
the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . 
holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . 
askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . 
no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . 
he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . 
the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . 
also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . 
the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . 
it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . 
the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . 
also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . 
still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . 
it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . 
because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent . 
unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . 
go is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . 
thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) 
they are who they are and they stay that way . 
go is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . 
ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . 
erm , go to go , i guess .

pos	"no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . 
event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me . 
it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . 
the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . 
the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . 
the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime . 
the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . 
a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . 
the designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . 
event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . 
while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . 
the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! 
i can't stand this anymore ! ' . 
there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . 
the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . 
even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . 
director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' . 
this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . 
although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . 
however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . 
my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon . 
i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . 
be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . 
be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! 
event horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! 
it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one .

pos	"clint eastwood , in his ripe old age , is cashing one talent in for another . 
midnight in the garden of good and evil is an eastwood-directed film clint isn't even in , and it's damn good . 
adapted from a best-selling john berendt novel based on true events , this movie is set in the bizarre georgia town of savannah , where people walk invisible dogs and attach horseflies to their head . 
and that's just the mayor . 
as director and producer , eastwood contributes a self- indulgent but very competent 150 minutes , neatly balancing drama , suspense and humor . 
like all great movies , midnight in the garden has a lot of funny moments that spring from the characters themselves , and not from some contrived , juvenile intrusion . 
the acting , from big-time stars john cusack and kevin spacey , is as good as you'd expect , but it's the supporting stable that gives the movie its offbeat charm . 
cusack plays a free-lance reporter sent to savannah to write a fluff story for town & country magazine about one of eccentric millionaire spacey's parties . 
lots of food , beverages and gunplay . 
yes , an employee of spacey's has a huge argument in front of cusack and later turns up dead . 
it seems like a simple matter of self- defense -- the guy threatened spacey , shot at him , missed , then spacey took him out -- but being a movie , there's much more to it than that , and cusack decides to stay in town and write a book about the murder , a book which will eventually become a movie he will star in . 
the weird circle of entertainment . 
this is where the stable of supporting characters comes in . 
there's the requisite sexy woman ( alison "" nepotist's daughter "" eastwood ) , the strange piano player , the voodoo woman and the transvestite . 
miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his/her own , as the stealer of every scene she appears in -- what would this movie be without the castilian scene and her testimony ? 
chablis , playing herself , is five times funnier than reigning drag queen rupaul , but never seems exploited as the movie's comic relief or out of place in a basically serious movie . 
there are also a fair share of courtroom scenes , which these days almost never seem welcome in a movie , but even here clint manages to keep the movie fascinating . 
certainly the characterizations of the judge and spacey's lawyer both help immensely , as does having the fly-guy as the jury's foreman . 
it's here we realize the case boils down to an indictment of spacey's homosexuality . 
yes , spacey had a sexual relationship with the dead man -- before he shot him , of course . 
midnight in the garden of good and evil isn't a classic , but it is one of the better celebrity-directed , true-story best-seller adaptations out there . 
likewise , no one from this movie will be getting any oscar nominations , but the performances are all great . 
in fact , i'd almost recommend that the academy add a best supporting transvestite category .

pos	  
pos	"well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started . 
so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era . 
with 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic' 
i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' . 
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in . 
i've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't see or think that once during the entire film . 
i get bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute . 
another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about "" well thats not really possible . ""

pos	"ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead . 
bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) . 
the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years . 
followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) . 
the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 . 
the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 . 
included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell . 
campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film . 
such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard . 
also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods . 
for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene . 
almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became "" confused "" and were unable to perform the scene . 
i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track . 
the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all . 
don't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time . 
sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask "" have anything to say sam ? "" 
to me , that's not a good sign . 
also , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . . 
well , compared to rob and bruce anyway . 
also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's "" gala "" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film . 
this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques . 
overall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it's genre . 
and the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process . 
all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining .

to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise .

dante's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . 
to be honest , i wasn't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn't make it sound promising . 
so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all . 
it's pretty run of the mill , but it's not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch . 
in case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? ) . 
pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . 
due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . 
brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day .

 . 
or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) . 
naturally the two will become infatuated with one another . 
 ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you haven't seen very many movies ! ) 
there's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . 
and of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . 
 .

but hey , i don't want to ruin all the surprises ! 
if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . 
it's not brain food , but it succeeds at what it's meant to be .

little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture . 
it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound . 
actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones , but was committed to his hit tv show , "" magnum p . i . "" . 
in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on . 
hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas . 
however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well . 
looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not . 
an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra . 
during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong . 
also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence . 
both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom . 
this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo . 
the same type of opening is present in its sequels . 
jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number "" ob-cpo "" . 
this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) . 
also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po . 
they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark . 
the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip . 
as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . 
spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy . 
the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed . 
when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that . 
when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on .

al pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( "" lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . "" , "" i have a million names . . . "" ) , as john milton -- the devil . 
the main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits . 
but the film , is something else , something original . 
part of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power . 
this is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . 
it is also entertaining . 
there is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye . 
the final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo . 
the central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . 
its nice to know that things like this are still being made .

of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there=92s some accomplished acting too . 
although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti-hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero .

mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation .

pos	"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . 
since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . 
the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . 
all the films released after it , have been less successful . 
david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . 
and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . 
i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . 
it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' . 
however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture . 
matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story . 
existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . 
'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between . 
instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . 
in a near future . . . on 
the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . 
right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . 
douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . 
a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . 
the first "" download into simulation "" is impressive . 
it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation . 
in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person . 
this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen . 
they start to doubt in their own sanity . 
these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives . 
it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy . 
with an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . 
our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . 
the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . 
this contrast demonstrates a wish for change . 
virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . 
to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . 
for others - a way to start over and "" correct "" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . 
virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . 
at least that's how it is all beginning . 
but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . 
this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . 
some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? 
what is thought ? 
who are we ? 
if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . 
they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . 
the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . 
kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . 
there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . 
a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects . 
there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . 
this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . 
this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased . 
this film is interesting and inspiring . 
it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . 
and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . 
the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' . 
with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . 
"
pos	"contrary to the title , "" the boxer "" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . 
it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . 
all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . 
we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be . 
oh well . 
it's still an excellent irish story . 
 "" the boxer "" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . 
first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . 
while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's "" shallow grave "" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . 
danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . 
and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( "" breaking the waves "" 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in . 
they don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . 
but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . 
the political story is nothing really special but works in itself . 
we've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . 
there's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . 
the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . 
there are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like "" raging bull "" /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant . 
they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . 
and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape . 
but the backbone of the story is the love one . 
because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . 
as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . 
this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . 
these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother . 
i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . 
it made sure that we didn't just care for one of them . 
i'm not saying they're all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . 
the acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . 
i'm not sure if they're oscar-nominee bound , but they're very good . 
in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . 
but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . 
the direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . 
i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . 
more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . 
though "" the boxer "" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . 
sure , it's a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it's own , it just could have been better . 
but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . 
even if it could have been better , this'll do .

pos	"in one scene from "" the people vs . 
larry flynt , "" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally . 
as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity . 
the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in "" patton "" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag . 
both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies . 
overall , that sums up "" the people vs . 
larry flynt . "" 
the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie . 
the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati . 
there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . 
to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . 
flynt , along with the magazine's rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody's real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . 
they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on "" what guys really want , "" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . 
the film's prime example of hustler's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt's "" naughtiness . "" 
director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine's frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons . 
flynt's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives . 
an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law . 
lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt's wife . 
norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior . 
in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . ) 
as keating blathers about flynt's immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud . 
flynt's other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse . 
tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down . 
a dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers . 
flynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids . 
after watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film's climactic courtroom scene . 
 "" the people vs , larry flynt "" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt . 
 "" if they'll protect a scumbag like me , then they'll protect all of you , "" declared flynt . 
he's right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons . 
he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt . 
harrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero . 
even a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man . 
an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one . 
despite its flaws , "" flynt "" is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod . 
the story may be candy-coated , but it's still delicious candy .

pos	"james cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . 
for those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . 
human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . 
however , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . 
to stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . 
in response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . 
images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film . 
even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . 
in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . 
in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . 
cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it . 
unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse . 
we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . 
children watch the flames in a burning television . 
when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . 
even though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . 
all sara can do is await it . 
 ( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) 
the end of the world is the human race's own fault , too . 
after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . 
back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron's ) . 
these days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . 
true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield's and lance henriksen's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . 
cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . 
from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . 
arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . 
we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger's later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . 
cameron and hurd's script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . 
while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese's intentions . 
cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . 
either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . 
the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom's heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator's ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . 
for a low budget film , the terminator's special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . 
special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . 
it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . 
one thing that doesn't hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton's hairdo .

pos	"okay , let me first say , this is a beavis and butthead movie . 
if you do not like beavis and butthead , do not go to see this movie ! ! ! ! ! 
however , if you do like them , i recommened you get out right now and go see it . 
the movie starts off with the boys wondering what happened to their tv . 
they notice that it has been stolen and they vow to find it . 
this wind their way through america searching for dallas ( she is a woman ) . 
they look for her because as they are searching for the tv , they find a drunk who wants them "" to do "" his wife . 
well , of course they think he wants them to score with her when actually he wants them to kill her . 
and the fun starts their . 
this movie is a mix of funny gags that anly beavis and butthead could pull off . 
it is quality entertainment that only fan of beavis and butthead would enjoy . 
i enjoyed this movie alot because mike judge knew how to keep pace . 
even when they were crawling through the desert and i thought the movie started to lag , he manages to keep the laughs coming . 
if you expecting changes from the show keep looking . 
the same character , the same voices , the same everything from the show and that's what makes it good . 
you might think with a movie from a tv show , you can change a few things . 
often times this spells disaster for films because the film makers veer away from what made the show popular in the first place ! 
"
pos	"if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it . 
scripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch . 
it starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store . 
because this is a tarantino movie , however , it's not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it's a case of a hole being shot through someone's hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away . 
the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems . 
clooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it . 
harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly . 
you know you're mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she's not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn . 
the first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney's strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet . 
it does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino . 
once they get to mexico , it's time to wait at the rendezvous point , a topless bar called titty twister where we're once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper . 
finally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire . 
soon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back . 
that's right , we've come all this way to see a vampire movie . 
but like everything else , tarantino takes this age-old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment . 
so we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes "" a lap dog of satan . "" 
the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they're entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest . 
clooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously . 
stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there's absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn . 
pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment . 
from dusk till dawn isn't the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie .

pos	"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture . 
the review 
if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . 
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . 
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious . 
featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing . 
black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . 
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . 
this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . 
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf . 
meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . 
others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean's girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . 
mike tyson . 
the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . 
friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . 
originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . 
while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . 
the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . 
the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . 
to toback's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . 
these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . 
whenever a character finds himself on donager's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . 
charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i'll be way over this . "" 
these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . 
toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . 
most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film's comic relief without really trying . 
he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson's image as a dimwit . 
but tyson also gets the film's scariest moment . 
as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . 
the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . 
the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr's face turns a frightening shade of purple . 
black & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film's omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this . 
but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character's struggle . 
thus black & white's message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself . 
toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way . 
and we do .

pos	"1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) . 
hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap . 
despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two . 
writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film . 
that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her . 
alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death . 
what could be next ? 
whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also "" infected "" with alien dna . 
so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude . 
unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops . 
the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features . 
but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought . 
the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them . 
and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy . 
while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon . 
the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so . 
the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence . 
the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji . 
as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series . 
a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun . 
no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was . 
but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride . 
that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments .

pos	"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . 
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . 
i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . 
in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . 
the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . 
ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . 
earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks . 
it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . 
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . 
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name . 
unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . 
fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day . 
with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . 
however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . 
there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . 
not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . 
with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . 
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work . 
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . 
one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment . 
one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . 
he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . 
ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out . 
it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . 
actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . 
the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . 
in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . 
it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late '92/early '93 . 
like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation . 
cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . 
however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her . 
heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . 
my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true . 
he and ralph macchio must hang out or something . 
maybe they live in dick clark's pool house . 
anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart . 
the supporting performances are also good . 
chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . 
lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . 
lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . 
the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags . 
the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . 
they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . 
it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . 
after that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . 
fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .

pos	"jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled "" kevin smith's greatest hits "" for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith's earlier works including , clerks , mall rats . 
chasing amy and dogma . 
so , be advised : bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith's latest outing . 
kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature , most notably miramax , the studio whose subsidiary , dimension films , is jay and silent bob's distributor . 
others deserving accolades include ben affleck , matt damon , directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas . 
this is a laugh-filled , foul-mouthed road film with jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( smith ) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax's production of bluntman and chronic , comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers . 
jay's convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down , people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob , even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing , but rather their comic book counterparts . 
no matter , the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country . 
but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker , played by george carlin , who tells them to follow "" the book "" - the rules of the road . 
of course jay's interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun ( carrie fisher ) who offers them a ride . 
jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie's weaker aspects - which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell - can be easily tolerated . 
really , how can you not laugh at a film in which our heroes are picked up by the mystery van , and jay has a pot-induced hallucination concerning velma and daphne . 
the movie's highlight , though , is near the finale . 
in hollywood , jay and silent bob sneak onto the miramax lot where they crash the set and are mistaken for extras of the latest affleck-damon picture , good will hunting 2 : hunting season . 
here we are privy to a hilarious conversation between affleck and damon in which the two put down each other's careers and film choices . 
and the laughs continue to grow . 
next up is jason ( american pie ) biggs and james ( dawson's creek ) van der beek , the actors chosen to portray bluntman and chronic . 
the pair mistake jay and silent bob for their stunt doubles . 
finally , comes a star wars homage featuring one of the stars of that legendary feature . 
this bit will leave you howling . 
smith's obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes and handles his performers . 
he allows them to play it all tongue-in-cheek . 
their fun comes through the screen to the audience . 
it is too bad that this is jay and silent bob's swan song . 
the characters have grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks . 
but smith realizes that times have changed , and he doesn't want his creations to overstay their welcome . 
so smith has provided them with just the right kind of exit , saving the best for last . 
goodbye jay and silent bob . 
at least you're going out with a blast .

pos	"in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . 
this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . 
old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . 
through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . 
what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit . 
after all , old ned won't miss it . 
rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . 
bannen and kelly are a perfect pair . 
one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . 
both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . 
waking ned devine may even be seen as a "" full monty "" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene . 
waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . 
the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . 
there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture . 
writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . 
scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception . 
perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . 
had i held off on my year's best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year's finest films . 
it is light , but thought provoking and sweet . 
i can't think of anyone who shouldn't see ( or wouldn't enjoy ) this film .

pos	" "" no man is an island , "" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes . 
while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . 
apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . 
1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . 
bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory . 
bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . 
the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . 
bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . 
marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his "" student "" , among other things . 
bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . 
dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . 
all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax . 
singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . 
his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . 
apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . 
thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . 
some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . 
mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work . 
he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do . 
 ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) 
renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . 
as guidance counsellor edward french , "" friend "" schwimmer also deserves mention . 
he wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent . 
but one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . 
no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the "" right "" or the "" wrong "" choices . 
schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible .

pos	"seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic's pass . 
[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] 
 "" rounders "" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see . 
it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . 
and to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . 
there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the "" noir "" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . 
this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . 
matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . 
damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . 
mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . 
but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . 
damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . 
he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . 
the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . 
immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . 
the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . 
the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . 
the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . 
it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . 
we learn only a little about mike , both past and present . 
presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . 
they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder "" worm "" ( norton ) is released from prison . 
it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . 
technically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the "" good "" kid's "" bad "" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . 
what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . 
mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . 
where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them . 
sometimes they pay off ( i . e . 
his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i . e . 
the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . 
once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . 
mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . 
everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals . 
one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . 
matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer . 
he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved . 
can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? 
if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . 
everything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own . 
this makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . 
it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . 
what separates "" rounders "" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end .

pos	"director dominic sena ( who made the highly underrated kalifornia ) and producer jerry bruckheimer ( the rock , armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . 
nicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who's "" pulled back in "" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . 
memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang . 
memphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well . 
gone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . 
in that sequence , we get a rockin' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects . 
filmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . 
and what follows doesn't disappoint . . . 
cage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . 
good or bad . . . 
i don't know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely . 
of the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she's definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i've ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . 
also , i'm a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . 
none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately . 
some underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles . 
delroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo's partner . 
i just wish some of the other characters could have been as important . 
the only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . . 
mainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll . 
there's no doubt in anyone's mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the "" rival car thief "" plot line . 
as it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package . 
but if i was making this film , i'd have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . 
thereby adding some meat to the plot . 
the finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren't ways to make car chases interesting anymore . 
it's all been done . 
the chase is also shot and edited in that "" jerry bruckheimer action sequence "" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . 
sure it's a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? 
it's very hard to tell . 
finally , there's a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the "" bus jumping the ramp "" sequence from speed in the "" oh , i don't think so . . . "" 
department . 
despite those minor complaints , gone in sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment . 
it's not thought provoking , but it's shiny , loud and fun . . . 
just what a summer flick should be .

pos	"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies . 
consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . 
top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . 
based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . 
told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . 
the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes . 
in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children . "" 
he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . 
picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . 
periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over . 
you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . 
they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured . 
and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . 
although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . 
ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . 
mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . 
his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . 
if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . 
the story unfolds slowly and always believably . 
each little aspect has its own fascination . 
as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . 
he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . 
wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults . 
although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . 
one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . 
well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . 
his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . 
the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . 
although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . 
as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . 
to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . 
his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . 
fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . 
 ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy . 
 "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back . 
mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) 
mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . 
the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . 
the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . 
still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . 
i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed . 
more than anything , the film is like a master painting . 
each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint . 
with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll . 
the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 . 
it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers .

the game went on until a player reached twenty one points on felt they had earned enough points to win . 
but , after ratings began to fall when players were struggling to break the zero mark , the producers decided to fix the game by giving the answers to a contestant before the game began . 
quiz show illustrates the true stories of two particular contestants , herbie stempel and charles van doren . 
stempel ( john turturro ) , a former g . i . 
and your jewish man raising a family . 
stempel has been the reigning champion on "" twenty-one "" for many weeks and has accumulated thousands of dollars . 
in his mind , he is the best thing on television and the people love him . 
although , in the mind of the show's producers , herbie stempel is getting old . 
dan enright ( david paymer ) , in particular , feels that the people are tired of seeing a "" jewish guy from queens with bad teeth "" and that the kids need someone better to look up to . 
therefore , they need to find another contestant whom would be a worthy role model and the people will look up to and cheer to win . 
someone who can defeat stempel , even if they have to resort to cheating . 
enter charles van doren ( ralph fiennes ) , a well-educated professor from a widely recognized family . 
van doren had decided to try out for the game show "" tic tac dough "" because his friends thought he would be good at that sort of thing . 
but when albert freedman ( hank azaria ) , enright's assistant , spots van doren , the two decide that they have found their soon-to-be-ruler of the "" twenty-one "" kingdom . 
van doren is not too keen on the idea of receiving the answers ahead of time , so enright tells stempel that he is going to give the wrong answer , on purpose , in order to lose the game . 
after stempel loses the "" throne "" to van doren , he starts to feel cheated ( which he should ) . 
meanwhile , on his own , dick goodwin ( rob morrow ) , a harvard law graduate , has decided to start an investigation on "" twenty-one "" to try and find out if there have been any wrongdoings . 
his investigation yields shocking results and leads to a trial for enright and the others involved . 
quiz show is an extremely well done movie , and robert redford's direction is especially superb . 
the performances turned in by john turturro , ralph fiennes , and rob morrow are very good , although it seems that turturro stands out more than any . 
quiz show is also very precise when it comes to explicating the true events that inspired the film . 
definitely a film you should not miss .

pos	"i was pleasantly surprised by this film . 
with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see . 
how much could you dress up the sets ? 
how many models and computer effects could you use ? 
how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ? 
oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school . 
after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie . 
there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen . 
titanic tells its story in two time periods . 
it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship . 
what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news . 
the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas . 
there she tells her story to lovett and his team . 
in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york . 
she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word . 
on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping . 
although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal . 
the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through . 
dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors . 
his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations . 
girls are going to swoon over him . 
winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable . 
the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing . 
simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante . 
rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting . 
billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him . 
his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate . 
he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model . 
like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well . 
backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century ) . 
no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match . 
additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie . 
nice to see dr . bombay getting work . 
also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die . 
this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else . 
in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures . 
you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well . 
as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects . 
the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic . 
with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale . 
cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet . 
could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless . 
also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning . 
we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner . 
these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion . 
in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action . 
the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending . 
in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship . 
"
pos	"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions . 
the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike . 
 ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . ) 
the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe . 
denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host . 
in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) . 
 ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word . ) 
unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans . 
one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate . 
others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of . 
my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams . 
arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do . 
her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well . 
 "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession . 
she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar . 
 "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us . 
her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith . 
along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty . 
and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment . 
few other avocations could give this much satisfaction . 
these people are having the time of their lives . 
 ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . ) 
the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans . 
the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong . 
filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions . 
at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel . 
after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left . 
they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus . "" 
the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too . 
with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity . 
not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies . 
one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist . 
the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set . 
he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time . 
it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family . 
for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time . 
he says his patients like it . 
well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway . 
there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language . 
hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible . 
they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs . 
the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns . 
sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work . 
the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator . 
he fits right in . 
trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 . 
it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages . 
"
pos	"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer . 
the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream . 
when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up . 
did it live up to the first film ? 
the answer is no . 
jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before . 
she has been so upset since the incident . 
nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on . 
she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle . 
karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer . 
freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago . 
one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil . 
of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas . 
julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie . 
after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island . 
it starts off as the weekend of their dreams . 
something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though . 
ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time . 
will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ? 
jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances . 
brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film . 
you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive . 
matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story . 
let's start with settle . 
matthew is completely fake in this film . 
you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth . 
you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one . 
he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film . 
freddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was . 
he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place . 
we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did . 
mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place . 
the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie . 
i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better . 
the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful . 
there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel . 
the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film's . 
jennifer love hewitt's song , "" how do i deal "" is also played for about thirty seconds . 
i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film . 
the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes . 
the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film . 
before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares . 
that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes . 
i think the reason this film wasn't as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident . 
he made them suffer for what they did . 
in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like . 
he doesn't stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after . 
he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell . 
if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense . 
the bottom line- not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand . 
"
pos	"no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan . 
i'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form . 
in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster . 
said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner . 
when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning . 
throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like "" the pied piper "" ( passages of which are read during the film ) . 
but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify . 
we finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect . 
a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture . 
the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident . 
i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera . 
for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people . 
but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much . 
also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue . 
perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner . 
there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers . 
i was half-right . 
nevertheless it's worth-seeing . 
the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , "" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed . 
the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it's not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) . 
egoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times . 
though i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter . 
"
pos	"expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) . 
roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . 
i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . 
the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . 
the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . 
one can almost sense the cold . 
but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . 
this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots . 
the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . 
this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . 
in the plane three men find ? the american dream . . . 
in a gym bag . ? 
affliction too was set in a snowy landscape . 
it really seems very simple . 
just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . 
but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes . 
as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . 
but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish . 
the movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . 
i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . 
the biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story . 
the writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book . 
this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author . 
the movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense . 
i'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what . 
even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included . 
the man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many . 
turns out . . . 
well , see the movie . 
one should be warned against seeing the trailer . 
it reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning . 
but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie .

pos	"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . 
with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa . 
attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . 
i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . 
as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . 
as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . 
crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . 
crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . 
it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . 
all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . 
the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . 
it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . 
the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . 
the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . 
the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . 
there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . 
as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . 
do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed . 
for those who are put off by the "" art "" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance . 
there are no weak performances in this movie . 
michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom . 
chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart . 
zhang ziyi is a budding superstar . 
she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role . 
cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably . 
kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film . 
ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit . 
this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies . 
don't miss it . 
"
pos	"it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . 
of course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there . 
payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . 
the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet . 
all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . 
it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . 
obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . 
porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . 
gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . 
you probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . 
harrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? 
this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . 
while he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . 
porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . 
payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done . 
the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? 
the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . 
the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . 
a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . 
just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .
